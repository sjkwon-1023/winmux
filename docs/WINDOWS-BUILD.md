# Windows Build Guide

How to set up a Windows machine to build and run winmux, and how to run the Windows-side
verification. Two apps share this guide:

- **`apps/winmux`** — the MVP app, active development from 계획 v2 section 17 stage 10
  onward (section 3 below).
- **`apps/spike`** — the Tauri v2 + xterm.js spike. Its sign-off was completed on
  2026-08-08 (candidate A adopted — see
  [`docs/adr/0001`](adr/0001-adopt-tauri-webview2-xterm-stack.md)); it's now **frozen as
  a measurement harness** — no new features land there, only compiling is kept green —
  and its build steps (section 2) and checklist (section 5) remain the reference for
  re-running those checks as regression tests during MVP work.

## 1. Prerequisites

### rustup + MSVC target(s)

Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) (defaults to the `stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` toolchain
on a 64-bit Windows install). Tauri on Windows requires the **MSVC** ABI, not GNU.

```powershell
winget install Rustlang.Rustup
```

After install, verify:

```powershell
rustup show
rustc --version
```

### Visual Studio Build Tools (C++)

Rust's MSVC toolchain needs the MSVC linker and Windows SDK, which come from Visual Studio
Build Tools — not the full Visual Studio IDE.

1. Install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
2. In the installer, select the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload.
3. Under "Individual components", make sure the MSVC target architecture(s) you need are
   selected:
   - **x64**: `MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools` (this dev machine's target)
   - **ARM64**: `MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ ARM64 build tools` (only needed if you'll build for
     ARM64 — see section 11)
4. Also confirm a **Windows 10/11 SDK** component is selected (the installer usually pulls one
   in automatically with the C++ workload).

Tauri also needs [WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/) — the
Evergreen runtime ships with Windows 11 and most updated Windows 10 installs already, so a
separate install step is usually unnecessary. If `npm run tauri dev` fails complaining about a
missing WebView2 runtime, install the "Evergreen Bootstrapper" from the link above.

### Node.js LTS

Install a current Node.js **LTS** release (from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or
`winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS`). `apps/spike` builds with npm scripts (`tsc` + `vite` +
`vitest`) that assume a recent Node LTS.

Verify:

```powershell
node --version
npm --version
```

## 2. Build and run `apps/spike`

From the repo root on Windows (adjust the path to wherever you cloned/checked out the repo):

```powershell
cd apps\spike
npm install
```

### Development (hot reload, dev console)

```powershell
npm run tauri dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server and launches the Tauri window pointed at it. Rust changes under
`src-tauri/` or `crates/winmux-core` trigger a rebuild; frontend changes hot-reload.

### Distributable exe (no installer/bundle)

```powershell
npm run tauri build -- --no-bundle
```

`--no-bundle` skips MSI/NSIS installer packaging (not needed for Spike verification) and leaves
a plain `winmux-spike.exe` under the **workspace root** `target\release\` — same reason as
section 3: the repo root is the cargo workspace, so `target/` lives there. This is the binary
[`scripts/win/measure.ps1`](../scripts/win/measure.ps1) expects by default (`-ProcessName
winmux-spike`, matching `productName` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`).

## 3. Build and run `apps/winmux`

`apps/winmux` is the MVP app (계획 v2 section 17, stage 10 onward) — same Tauri v2 +
Node/npm toolchain as `apps/spike` above, but its Rust glue drives the `winmux-core`
`Dispatcher` over the single `Command` bus instead of spike's thin per-call commands.
Architecture: [`docs/adr/0002`](adr/0002-stage10-architecture.md) and
[`docs/adr/0003`](adr/0003-split-tab-ui-architecture.md).

From the repo root on Windows:

```powershell
cd apps\winmux
npm install
```

### Development (hot reload, dev console)

```powershell
npm run tauri dev
```

Same rebuild behavior as spike: Rust changes under `src-tauri/` or `crates/winmux-core`
trigger a rebuild, frontend changes hot-reload. On boot the app itself dispatches a
single atomic `CreateWorkspace{tab}` (from Tauri `setup`, before the frontend ever
attaches — stage 13 folded the earlier `CreateWorkspace` + `CreateTab` pair into one
command), so a terminal tab is already running when the window opens. Splits/tabs
(stages 11–12) and the workspace sidebar (stage 13) are mouse-driven; commands without
UI yet can still be driven from the WebView dev console via the dev hook
`window.__winmux.dispatch(command)`. See section 6 below for the stage 10 manual
checklist that exercises this.

### Distributable exe (no installer/bundle)

```powershell
npm run tauri build -- --no-bundle
```

Leaves a plain `winmux-app.exe` under the **workspace root** `target\release\` — not under
`apps\winmux\src-tauri\`, because the repo root is the cargo workspace and that is where
cargo puts `target/`. The binary is named after the cargo package (`winmux-app`), not after
`productName`; `--no-bundle` skips the bundling step that would apply the product name.

Cross-compiling adds the triple: `--target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` writes to
`target\aarch64-pc-windows-msvc\release\winmux-app.exe`. That is the path
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) uploads, verified by a real
`workflow_dispatch` run of the `windows-artifacts` job for both targets.

## 4. `WINMUX_DISTRO` environment variable

Both apps spawn the WSL shell as `wsl.exe [-d $WINMUX_DISTRO] -- bash -l` — spike's glue
reads it directly per spawn (see spike-plan.md section 4.5); winmux threads it through
`winmux-core`'s `Command::CreateWorkspace` → `ShellSpawnReq::distro` (see
`crates/winmux-core/src/command.rs`), same underlying `wsl.exe` invocation either way.
`WINMUX_DISTRO` selects which WSL distribution to spawn into:

- **Unset**: `wsl.exe` uses your default distribution (`wsl -l -v` shows which one has `*`).
- **Set**: `wsl.exe -d <name>` targets that distribution explicitly — useful if you have more
  than one installed (e.g. a plain Ubuntu install alongside an isolated/sandboxed distro for
  agent work) and want the app to consistently target one of them regardless of which is
  marked default.

Set it for the current PowerShell session before launching the app:

```powershell
$env:WINMUX_DISTRO = "Ubuntu-24.04"
npm run tauri dev
```

or persist it for your user account (`setx WINMUX_DISTRO "Ubuntu-24.04"`, new shells only).

## 5. Spike verification checklist (regression reference)

The verification checklist — OSC passthrough, Claude Code/Codex behavior, IME, flow control,
renderer comparison, RAM measurement — is [`docs/plans/spike-plan.md`](plans/spike-plan.md)
section 6 ("Windows Spike 검증 체크리스트"). It was fully executed for the Spike sign-off
(results in ADR-0001) and, now that `apps/spike` is frozen as a measurement harness (section
2), doubles as the regression checklist for MVP-era changes. This runs against `apps/spike`;
`apps/winmux`'s own stage 10 checklist is section 6 below.

Scripts referenced by that checklist:

- [`scripts/wsl/osc-test.sh`](../scripts/wsl/osc-test.sh) — run **inside the WSL terminal that
  the Spike app opened**, from a Windows-side terminal you do *not* need this for. Emits OSC
  0/7/9/777 with both BEL and ST terminators, plus a chunk-split case.
- [`scripts/wsl/flood.sh`](../scripts/wsl/flood.sh) — `yes`-speed output burst (and an optional
  `--random-lines` high-entropy burst) for the flow control / backpressure check.
- [`scripts/wsl/scrollback-test.sh`](../scripts/wsl/scrollback-test.sh) — emits 12,000 lines to
  confirm the 5,000-line scrollback cap actually evicts old lines.
- [`scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md`](../scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md) — the canonical
  OSC contract (`winmux:` status tokens, title/cwd) plus the Claude Code hook and shell-prompt
  snippets that emit it, for the agent-notification half of the checklist.
- [`scripts/win/measure.ps1`](../scripts/win/measure.ps1) — run from a **Windows** PowerShell
  prompt (not inside WSL) while the Spike app is running, to record private working set (WebView2
  process tree included) over time and export it to CSV:

  ```powershell
  .\scripts\win\measure.ps1 -ProcessName winmux-spike -IntervalSec 5 -Samples 12 -OutCsv .\ram-4pane.csv
  ```

  No administrator privileges are required.

## 6. Stage 10 manual verification checklist

This was stage 10's completion gate on top of the automated gates in `CLAUDE.md`; it
**passed on Windows** (decisions distilled into
[`docs/adr/0002`](adr/0002-stage10-architecture.md)) and remains here as a regression
checklist for later work on the attach protocol and dispatcher.

1. **Boot** — launching the app auto-creates a workspace and a terminal tab (the
   dispatcher issues `CreateWorkspace` + `CreateTab` from Tauri `setup`, dogfooding the
   same `Command` bus the UI will use later); the terminal accepts input immediately.
2. **Reload survives** — type something with a distinguishable marker (e.g. `echo
   RELOAD-MARK-1`), then reload the WebView with **Ctrl+Shift+R** (or `window.__winmux.reload()` from the
   dev console). Plain F5 is *not* a reload key here — with the terminal focused, xterm
   correctly delivers F5 to the shell as `ESC[15~` (TUI apps like htop use it), which is
   why pressing it just prints a stray `~`.
   The session and its printed text must still be there afterward — that's the stage 10
   bar ("세션 생존 + 텍스트 보존"); pixel-perfect redraw of the TUI screen itself is out
   of scope until stage 14 (plan section 0-2).
3. **Dev-hook commands land** — from the WebView dev console, drive
   `window.__winmux.dispatch(...)` with `CreateTab`, `CloseTab`, and `SplitPane` commands.
   Each should update the `state-changed` snapshot, and closing tabs/panes must not leave
   orphaned WSL/shell processes behind (check via Task Manager, or `ps` inside WSL).
4. **IDs are stable across reload** — note the `Pane`/`Tab` ids from `get_state` (or the
   dev hook's command output) before reloading, reload, and confirm they're unchanged
   afterward.
5. **Background tab stays free-running** — create a second terminal tab, start a long
   noisy command in it (e.g. `seq 1000000`), switch back to the first tab, wait a few
   seconds, then check `window.__winmux` dev hook → `get_stats` (or `invoke("get_stats")`):
   the background session must show `paused: false` and keep making progress.
   *(Historical note: when this item was written, tab switching disposed the view and
   detached its channel. Since stage 12 landed keep-alive views, switching tabs keeps the
   hidden view attached and acking — the item still holds, it now verifies the keep-alive
   ack path instead of detach-on-dispose.)*
6. **`root_path` workspace spawns in the right directory** — dispatch
   `createWorkspace` with a `rootPath` (absolute **Linux** path, e.g. `/home/<user>`),
   create a terminal tab in it, and confirm `pwd` prints that path. This is the first
   real-world use of the `wsl.exe --cd <path>` mapping (spike only ever used
   `wsl.exe -- bash -l`); relative or Windows-style paths are not supported there.

## 7. Stage 11–12 manual verification checklist

This was stages 11–12's completion gate on top of the automated gates; it **passed on
Windows 2026-08-09** (decisions distilled into
[`docs/adr/0003`](adr/0003-split-tab-ui-architecture.md)) and remains here as a
regression checklist for split/tab UI work. All UI is mouse-driven; the dev hook is only
needed where noted.

1. **Splits render and nest** — use the pane-header icons to split left/right and
   top/bottom, then split one of the halves again. Layout must match the icon direction
   (horizontal = side by side, vertical = stacked), each new pane opens with a running
   terminal tab (atomic `SplitPane{tab}` — no empty-pane flash), and focus moves to the
   new pane.
2. **Splitter drag survives reload** — drag a splitter (live preview while dragging, no
   command spam), release, then reload (Ctrl+Shift+R). The adjusted ratio must persist (it lives in Rust
   state, not the DOM). Also observe: if a structural change arrives mid-drag (e.g. a
   session exits in another pane), the drag is deliberately abandoned — the preview snaps
   back and no resize command is sent (expected behavior, not a bug).
3. **Tabs: create/switch/close** — multiple terminal tabs per pane via the header icon;
   switching is instant with **no replay flash** (keep-alive views — the terminal content
   must not visibly re-render from scratch); closing a tab kills only that session.
   **A single click on an *inactive* pane's tab must land** (activate the tab, not just
   focus the pane) — regression guard for a mid-click re-render that used to require two
   clicks.
4. **Hidden tab keeps flowing** — run `bash ~/code/winmux/scripts/wsl/flood.sh 10` in a
   tab, switch away, wait, switch back: the buffer shows the latest output and
   `get_stats` shows `paused: false` throughout (hidden views keep acking).
5. **Unvisited tab after reload keeps flowing** — create a second tab, start `seq
   1000000` in it, reload (Ctrl+Shift+R), and do **not** click that tab. Check `get_stats`: the session must
   show `paused: false` (the boot reconcile sweeps `detach_terminal` over unattached
   sessions — the post-reload freeze fix). Then click the tab: latest output appears via
   replay.
6. **Last tab closes the pane** — closing the last tab of a pane collapses the pane
   (sibling takes the space, focus falls back); closing the last tab of the *last* pane
   leaves an empty pane with the placeholder, and the header icons still work from there.
   After any tab close, keyboard input must land in the surviving tab **without an extra
   click** (focus compensation — a removed xterm otherwise drops focus to the body).
7. **2×2 reload** — build a 2×2 layout with running TUIs (e.g. `htop`), reload (Ctrl+Shift+R): all four
   panes re-attach with their sessions and text intact, and the TUIs redraw after the
   resize nudge. Pane/Tab/Split ids unchanged (`get_state`).
8. **Errors surface** — from the dev console, dispatch `resizeSplit` with a stale id
   (e.g. `{ type: "resizeSplit", split: 9999, ratio: 0.5 }`): the status line shows the
   error and the layout stays consistent.
9. **RAM reference** — with the 2×2 layout idle, run `scripts/win/measure.ps1
   -ProcessName winmux` and note the total against the 계획 v2 section 16 budget
   (≤150MB); this is a reference point, not a hard gate for these stages.

## 8. Stage 13 manual verification checklist

This is stage 13's completion gate on top of the automated gates: the workspace sidebar
— create/switch/close workspaces from the UI (계획 v2 section 17 stage 13; design
decisions in [ADR-0004](adr/0004-lifecycle-persistence-reset.md)). All
interactions are mouse-driven in the sidebar; the dev hook is only needed where noted.

1. **Boot workspace card** — on launch the sidebar shows one card for the boot
   workspace with the active highlight, its name, and the status line (`idle` until an
   agent reports otherwise), matching the workspace rendered on the right. (The card
   carries no pane/tab counts and no git branch — see §10 item 11.)
2. **Create via the sidebar form** — click "+ New workspace", enter a name (rootPath
   optional — absolute **Linux** path, e.g. `/home/<user>`), submit. A new card
   appears, the app switches to the new workspace, and a terminal tab is already
   running with keyboard focus (atomic `CreateWorkspace{tab}` — no empty-workspace
   flash). If a `rootPath` was given, `pwd` prints it.
3. **Background workspace keeps flowing** — in the first workspace start a long noisy
   command (e.g. `seq 1000000` or `bash ~/code/winmux/scripts/wsl/flood.sh 10`), switch
   to another workspace via its card, wait a few seconds, then check `get_stats` from
   the dev console: the background session must show `paused: false` and keep making
   progress (leaving a workspace disposes its views; the detach sweep frees the
   channels so nothing sticks at paused).
4. **Switch-back restores** — switch back to the first workspace: layout, tabs, and
   terminal output are restored via replay (lazy attach), and keyboard input lands in
   the active pane **without an extra click** (focus compensation). Pane/Tab ids
   unchanged (`get_state`).
5. **Close kills sessions** — click a card's ×: a confirm dialog appears when the
   workspace has **running** terminal sessions (exited-only workspaces close without
   one); **cancelling the dialog must change nothing** (workspace and sessions stay).
   After confirming, the card disappears and no orphaned WSL/shell processes remain
   (Task Manager, or `ps` inside WSL). Closing the *last* workspace leaves the empty
   state ("no workspace" on the right), and the sidebar form still creates a fresh
   workspace from there.
6. **Reload keeps the workspace list** — with 2+ workspaces, reload (Ctrl+Shift+R):
   the card list, active workspace, and all ids are unchanged (state lives in Rust,
   the WebView is just a view).

## 9. Stage 14–16 / Checkpoint 1 manual verification

This is **checkpoint 1** (roadmap decision in `CLAUDE.md`): the batched manual Windows
verification for stages 13–16 — workspace sidebar (section 8 doubles as its checklist),
replay trim + switch latency tracer (stage 14), persistence (stage 15), and the automatic
UI reset safety net (stage 16, 계획 v2 section 12). It **passed on Windows 2026-08-09**
(decisions and ConPTY field findings distilled into
[`docs/adr/0004`](adr/0004-lifecycle-persistence-reset.md)) and remains here as a
regression checklist.

### Auto-reset environment variables

The reset supervisor reads six environment variables at app start (set them in the
PowerShell session before `npm run tauri dev`, e.g. `$env:WINMUX_RESET_IDLE_SECS = "30"`).
`0` disables the trigger it belongs to; invalid values fall back to the default with a
loud stderr warning. The effective config is printed to stderr on boot
(`[winmux] reset: config ...`).

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `WINMUX_RESET_IDLE_SECS` | `1800` | Idle reset: fire once this many seconds after the last real user input (`0` = off). Re-arms only on the next real input. |
| `WINMUX_RESET_HIDDEN_SECS` | `600` | Hidden reset: fire after the window stays unfocused **and** invisible for this long continuously (`0` = off). Once per hidden stretch. |
| `WINMUX_RESET_MEM_MB` | `1536` | Memory watchdog: when the WebView2 process tree's private memory exceeds this many MB, schedule a reset for the next safe moment (`0` = off). |
| `WINMUX_RESET_MEM_POLL_SECS` | `60` | Watchdog sampling period. `0` is rejected (would busy-loop) — default + warning. |
| `WINMUX_RESET_SAFE_IDLE_SECS` | `60` | Seconds since the last input for a pending watchdog reset to count as "safe" (`0` = immediately safe). |
| `WINMUX_RESET_COOLDOWN_SECS` | `300` | Suppression window after any reset fires (`0` = no cooldown). |

Reset activity is stderr-only by design (no UI): look for `[winmux] reset: reloading
webview (trigger=...)` lines. A manual reset is available from the dev console as
`window.__winmux.resetUi()` (dev hook / future MCP only — there is deliberately no UI
button, 계획 v2 section 12).

### Checklist

1. **Persistence round-trip** — build 2 workspaces with splits, tabs, and an adjusted
   splitter ratio → quit and restart the app → the full structure (workspaces, panes,
   tabs, ratios, active selections, ids) is restored, and every terminal tab runs a
   **fresh shell** (session content is not persisted — only structure).
2. **A restart revives an exited tab** ([ADR-0010](adr/0010-restart-dead-terminal-tabs.md);
   until v0.3.8 this item read the opposite — "exited tabs stay exited") — exit a shell
   (`exit`) so the tab shows the exited badge and the Restart banner, restart the app → that
   tab comes back with a **live shell** in its stored directory, no badge and no banner, and
   the app is otherwise fully functional. Within a single run the badge stays until the user
   presses Restart: winmux does not resurrect a shell under the user.
3. **Corrupt state recovers loudly** — corrupt `state.json` (e.g. truncate it) in the app
   data dir, restart → the app starts fresh, keeps the original as
   `state.json.corrupt-<epoch>`, and logs the reason to stderr.
4. **Switch latency readout** — build a 4-pane workspace plus a second workspace, switch
   back and forth → read `window.__winmux.lastSwitch` in the dev console: total should be
   in the ~100ms class, with per-tab replay timings populated.
5. **Replay trim keeps lines whole** — flood 1MB+ of colored output (e.g.
   `bash ~/code/winmux/scripts/wsl/flood.sh`), switch away and back → the top of the
   restored buffer starts at a line boundary with no broken escape sequences /
   half-colored garbage.
6. **Idle reset fires once, invisibly** — set `WINMUX_RESET_IDLE_SECS=30` (and
   `WINMUX_RESET_COOLDOWN_SECS=0` for this item), leave the app alone for 30s → exactly one
   reset fires (stderr `trigger=idle`); sessions and terminal text survive and the reload
   is visually seamless. Keep waiting another 30s **without touching anything**: no
   second reset — the post-reset automatic attach/resize/ack must **not** re-arm the idle
   timer (only real input does). **Repeat the whole item with `vim` (or Claude Code)
   running in a tab**: TUI apps emit terminal queries (DA/DSR/color) that xterm
   auto-answers after the replay, and those synthetic writes must not re-arm idle either
   (review finding — stdin writes deliberately don't count as activity; only the
   frontend's real-gesture ping does).
7. **Hidden reset, and never while typing** — set `WINMUX_RESET_HIDDEN_SECS=30`, minimize
   or fully cover + unfocus the window for 30s → reset fires. Then keep the window
   focused and type continuously for well past 30s → **no** reset ever fires (guards
   against a spurious `Focused(false)` misdetection — real input re-arms the hidden
   countdown too).
8. **Mem watchdog waits for a safe moment** — set `WINMUX_RESET_MEM_MB=100` (trivially
   exceeded) → while typing/scrolling nothing fires; stop touching the app for
   `WINMUX_RESET_SAFE_IDLE_SECS` (or switch workspaces) → the pending reset fires
   (`trigger=memWatchdog` with the sampled bytes in stderr).
9. **Scrollback reading is activity** — with `WINMUX_RESET_IDLE_SECS=30`, read scrollback
   using **wheel only** (no keys) for over 30s → no reset fires (the throttled activity
   ping counts pure viewing as activity).
10. **Kill survives** — force-kill the app from Task Manager, restart → state is restored
    except at most the last ≤500ms of structural mutations (save debounce window).

## 10. Stage 17+ / Checkpoint 2 manual verification

This section collects the batched manual Windows verification for the stages after
checkpoint 1, to be run at **checkpoint 2** (after stage 21). Items are appended per
stage as each lands.

<!-- retired 2026-08-10 — see ADR (agent-facing channel is a v2 follow-up); the checklist below stays as a historical record of what was verified. -->

### Stage 17 — pane-to-pane text send (계획 v2 section 8)

The pane header gains two send icons: `⤷` (send selection) and `⤷⏎` (send & run).
Clicking one captures the current selection of that pane's shown terminal and enters
target-selection mode (status line prompt, crosshair cursor); the next primary-button
mousedown on a pane delivers.

1. **Send selection** — select text in one terminal, click that pane's `⤷` icon: the
   status line shows `send: click a pane to send to (Esc cancels)`; click another pane →
   the text appears on the target's input line **without executing** (no Enter is sent),
   and the prompt clears.
2. **Send & run is a separate gesture** — repeat with `⤷⏎`: the text is pasted *and*
   followed by exactly one CR in the target (a shell command runs once). The two icons
   stay visually and behaviorally distinct (mis-run guard).
3. **Bracketed paste safety (vim target)** — open `vim` in the target pane, enter insert
   mode, and send a multi-line selection with `⤷` (send only): the text lands as a paste —
   no autoindent staircase, no literal `ESC[200~`/`ESC[201~` fragments, and **nothing is
   executed** (send-only must never run anything in the target, TUI or shell).
4. **Multi-line to a non-bracketed target is refused** — with a target whose foreground
   program does *not* enable bracketed paste (e.g. plain `cat` waiting on stdin, or a
   bare shell with bracketed paste off), sending a **multi-line** selection with either
   icon is refused with a status-line error (`cannot send multi-line: target is not in
   bracketed paste mode`), and **nothing** is written to the target. Rationale: without
   bracketed paste the target cannot distinguish pasted newlines from Enter, so the
   intermediate lines would execute — refusing is the only safe behavior. A
   **single-line** send to the same target still works (and with `⤷` never executes).
5. **No selection surfaces an error** — with no selection in the source terminal (or with
   an empty pane / non-terminal placeholder shown), clicking either icon shows a one-shot
   status-line error (`no selection to send` / `cannot send: no terminal shown in this
   pane`) and does **not** enter target-selection mode.
6. **Esc and self-click cancel** — arm send mode, press Esc → the prompt clears, nothing
   is sent, and the next pane click focuses normally (the Esc must not leak into the
   terminal). Arm again and click the **source** pane itself → cancelled the same way
   (self-send is meaningless).
7. **Workspace switch auto-cancels** — arm send mode, then switch to another workspace
   (sidebar click): the prompt clears and the mode is cancelled — a pane click in the new
   workspace focuses normally instead of delivering (cross-workspace send is out of scope
   for v1).
8. **Exited target surfaces an error** — arm send mode and click a pane whose shown
   terminal has **exited** (run `exit` there first): a status-line error appears
   (`cannot send: target terminal has exited`) and nothing is silently dropped.
9. **Send & run ordering** — with `⤷⏎` and a multi-line selection into a bracketed-paste
   shell, the full pasted text always lands **before** the single CR (the command that
   runs is the complete pasted text, never a truncated prefix).

### Stage 18 — OSC notification routing + coalescing + keyed reconcile (계획 v2 section 9; contract in [ADR-0006](adr/0006-osc-notification-routing.md) and [`scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md`](../scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md))

OSC 777/9 agent notifications and OSC 0 (alias "2")/7 are now routed into the Rust model
through a 100ms-trailing-window coalescer (`OscRouter`), surfacing on three layers: the
tab's unread dot, the pane header's aggregate badge (`●`), and the workspace sidebar card
(status text, message preview, aggregate unread dot). The frontend applies snapshot
updates with keyed in-place reconcile (sidebar cards and tab-strip entries patch by id
instead of rebuilding the DOM) — this is what guards the ADR-0003 d7 mid-click swallow
regression once the model fields are dynamic.

1. **Synthetic OSC routing (`osc-test.sh`)** — with a background tab (not the pane's
   shown terminal, in a non-active workspace), run
   [`scripts/wsl/osc-test.sh`](../scripts/wsl/osc-test.sh)'s OSC 777 cases (7–9; 9 is the
   chunk-split case) and OSC 9 cases (5–6) against it: the tab gets an unread dot, the pane header's `●` badge lights,
   and the workspace's sidebar card shows the aggregate unread dot (OSC 9 / a
   token-mismatched 777 are status-neutral — `agentStatus` on the card must **not**
   change). Repeat while that tab is the pane's **shown** terminal: no dot appears at all
   (visible-tab suppression happens at apply time, not just on next activation).
2. **Real Claude Code + hook 3-tuple** — run Claude Code in a winmux tab with the
   `UserPromptSubmit`/`Notification`/`Stop` hooks from `claude-hook-example.md` wired up:
   submitting a prompt shows `running` (no dot), a permission prompt shows `needsInput`
   with the sidebar preview populated from the hook's message (dot set), and finishing a
   turn shows `idle` (dot set, preview persists — an empty body never clears the previous
   message). Activating the tab clears its dot immediately.
3. **needsInput priority across tabs** — with one tab's session at `needsInput`, trigger
   `winmux:running` on a **different** tab (`osc-test.sh` case 10, or another hook run): the
   workspace's sidebar status stays `needsInput` — only the same tab that raised it
   (`agentStatusSource`) can demote it, which happens naturally once its own
   `UserPromptSubmit` fires `running`.
4. **Click during a live title update (d7 regression guard)** — with a tab emitting OSC
   0/2 titles on a fast loop (or repeated `osc-test.sh` case 1/2 runs) so the tab strip is
   patching in place, click that tab repeatedly: activation must land every time, never
   swallowed by a re-render replacing the clicked element underneath the pointer.
5. **[conditional] cwd restore across restart** — `cd` to a distinct directory in a tab
   (letting the `~/.bashrc` `PROMPT_COMMAND` snippet from `claude-hook-example.md` emit
   OSC 7), quit and restart the app → the respawned shell's `pwd` matches that directory.
   ConPTY's real-world OSC 7 emission is an **unverified precondition** (plan risk,
   [ADR-0006](adr/0006-osc-notification-routing.md); verified at checkpoint 2) — if this
   fails it is **not a stage blocker**: fall back to the reduced scope (title/cwd routing
   stays landed, only the restart-respawn behavior is unverified) and revisit the
   file/socket cwd-passing alternative from 계획 v2 section 2 separately; it is independent
   of the notification path covered by items 1–4 and 6–8.
6. **OSC flood** — run [`scripts/wsl/flood.sh`](../scripts/wsl/flood.sh) in a tab: the UI
   stays responsive throughout (coalescing keeps model updates at the 100ms flush cadence
   regardless of OSC volume — `WINMUX_OSC_FLUSH_MS`), the persistence Saver's debounce cadence
   is undisturbed, and RAM stays stable (no unbounded growth from the flood).
7. **Closing a needsInput tab returns the sidebar to idle** — with a tab at `needsInput`,
   close it via **CloseTab**, then repeat and close via **ClosePane** instead: in both
   cases, if that tab was the workspace's `agentStatusSource`, the sidebar reverts to
   `idle` with no lingering dot.
8. **Restart clears notifications and status (sanitize)** — with a tab left at
   `needsInput`/`idle` with an unread dot and a sidebar preview message, restart the app:
   every workspace's `agentStatus` is `idle` with no `agentStatusSource` or
   `lastAgentMessage`, and every tab's `notification` is cleared — same guarantee as the
   existing `pty_session` reset, extended to the new notification fields.

### Stage 20 — three-tier keyboard navigation (계획 v2 "키보드 모델"; the canonical interception list lives in the [`apps/winmux/src/keys.ts`](../apps/winmux/src/keys.ts) module doc)

One movement key per tier: `Ctrl+1`…`Ctrl+9` (workspace), `Alt+arrows` (pane focus, by
on-screen adjacency), `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` (tab cycle inside the active pane).
All three are window-level capture handlers, so they work with the terminal focused. When
a key has no target (ordinal past the last workspace, already-active workspace, no pane in
that direction, 0–1 tabs) the app does nothing — silently, with no status-line error.

1. **Workspace switch (`Ctrl+1`…`Ctrl+9`)** — with 2+ workspaces and a terminal focused,
   press `Ctrl+2`: the sidebar's **second** card becomes active (1-based, sidebar order)
   and focus lands in that workspace's active pane (typing goes to its terminal
   immediately). Pressing the ordinal of the **already active** workspace, or an ordinal
   past the last card (e.g. `Ctrl+9` with 3 workspaces), does nothing at all.
2. **Pane focus move (`Alt+arrows`)** — in a workspace split into 2x2 panes, `Alt+→` /
   `Alt+↓` / `Alt+←` / `Alt+↑` move the active-pane highlight to the geometrically
   adjacent pane each time, and the newly focused pane's terminal receives typing. At an
   edge (e.g. `Alt+→` from the rightmost pane) and in a single-pane workspace, nothing
   happens and no error appears.
3. **Tab cycle (`Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`)** — in a pane with 3 tabs, `Ctrl+Tab`
   advances through them in tab-strip order and **wraps** from the last back to the first;
   `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` walks the same cycle backwards. The activated tab's terminal takes
   focus. In a pane with 0 or 1 tabs, nothing happens.
4. **Intercepted keys never reach the shell** — with a shell prompt focused, press each of
   the keys above (including the no-op cases from items 1–3, such as `Ctrl+9` with fewer
   workspaces): the command line stays empty — no stray digits, no `^I`/tab completion
   triggered, no escape-sequence garbage — and no line is ever submitted. Then confirm the
   keys **not** in the interception list still belong to the terminal: a bare `Tab`
   completes a path, bare arrow keys walk shell history/cursor, and `Ctrl+C` still
   interrupts a running command.
5. **[conditional] `Ctrl+Tab` reaches the page in WebView2** — item 3 depends on WebView2
   delivering `Ctrl+Tab` to the page instead of consuming it as a host-level shortcut,
   which is an **unverified precondition** (plan risk). If `Ctrl+Tab` produces no tab
   change *and* leaves nothing in the terminal, the interception itself is fine but the
   key never arrives: this is **not a stage blocker** — items 1, 2 and 4 stand on their
   own, and the follow-up is to pick a replacement binding (e.g. `Ctrl+PgUp`/`Ctrl+PgDn`)
   in `keys.ts` and re-run item 3. Record which behavior you observed.

### Stage 21 — viewer tabs (folderBrowser / textViewer / markdownViewer; 계획 v2 "탭 타입별 동작"; contract in [ADR-0008](adr/0008-viewer-tabs.md))

Tabs are no longer terminals only. The pane header's `▤` icon opens a **folderBrowser**
tab, and clicking a file row there opens a viewer tab in the same pane — a
**markdownViewer** for `.md`/`.markdown`, a **textViewer** for everything else. All three
are viewers, never editors. The Rust side reads the WSL filesystem through
`\\wsl.localhost\<distro>\...` (`fs_list_dir` / `fs_stat` / `fs_read_chunk`), so these
items exercise a Windows→WSL path that has no equivalent on the Linux dev host — none of
it can be checked before this checkpoint. Two contracts drive most of the items:
navigation is a **dispatcher command** (`navigateFolder`), so the current path is part of
the persisted model; and a viewer tab is mounted **only while it is the active tab of its
pane**, so leaving and returning is a real unmount/remount.

1. **Folder browser opens on the workspace root** — click the pane header's `▤` icon: a
   new tab opens in that pane listing the workspace's `rootPath` (`/` when the workspace
   has none), with **directories first** and each group sorted by name (case-insensitive).
   Directory rows end with `/`, file rows show a size, and a directory with more than
   5,000 entries shows the truncation banner instead of hanging.
2. **Navigation goes through the model** — click into a subdirectory, then use the `..`
   row to come back: the listing and the **tab title** follow the path each time. Now
   restart the app: the tab reopens on the **last visited path**, and the listing is a
   fresh read — create a file in that directory from WSL before restarting and it is there
   without any refresh gesture.
3. **A huge file opens instantly and stays bounded** — from WSL, make a few-hundred-MB log
   (`yes "$(date)" | head -c 400M > /tmp/big.log`) and click it in the folder browser: the
   text tab appears **immediately** (no multi-second freeze), and the bar above the text
   reads `bytes 0–… of …`. With `scripts/win/measure.ps1 -ProcessName winmux` taken before
   and after, the private working set grows by **less than 20MB**. Then walk with `next` /
   `prev` / `last` / `first`: each button loads exactly one 512KiB window, the byte range
   updates, and the working set does **not** grow with the number of jumps — only one
   window is resident, and scrolling to the end of a window never continues automatically.
4. **Scroll position survives unmount and restart** — scroll to the middle of a text tab,
   switch to another tab in that pane and back: the same lines are on screen (the position
   is recorded ~0.5s after scrolling settles, and immediately on leaving the tab). Restart
   the app: the same lines again. Repeat once in a window **other than the first** (jump
   with `next`, scroll, leave, return) — the recorded value is a byte offset, so the
   restored view must land in that window, not back at the top of the file.
5. **Background viewer tabs hold no DOM** — with a viewer tab in the background (another
   tab active in that pane), inspect that pane's `.pane-content` in devtools: there is no
   `.folder-view` / `.text-view` element for the background tab. Activating it again
   re-mounts and re-reads.
6. **Missing and deleted files surface inline** — with a text tab open, delete the file
   from WSL, then leave the tab and come back: the tab **stays open** and shows
   `cannot read <path>: …` where the content was. Same shape for a folder browser whose
   directory was removed (`cannot list <path>: …`), and its `..` row still navigates out.

7. **Markdown renders and reloads live** — click a `.md` file in the folder browser: it
   opens **rendered** (headings, lists, code blocks), not as source. With that tab active,
   append a line from WSL (`echo '## appended' >> notes.md`): the rendered view picks it up
   within **2–4 seconds** without any gesture, and the scroll position stays where it was.
   Now switch to another tab in that pane and, from WSL, append again: nothing polls while
   the viewer is unmounted, and coming back re-reads once and shows the new content.
   Minimize the window (or switch to another app so the WebView reports `document.hidden`)
   and confirm from devtools that no `fs_stat` traffic continues while hidden; restoring
   the window resumes the 2s cycle. Finally, open a `.md` file **larger than 2MiB**: it
   refuses to render, says so in the banner, and offers **open as text** — clicking that
   opens the same path in a textViewer tab.
8. **Raw HTML is inert and links do nothing** — put this in a `.md` file and open it:
   `<script>alert('x')</script>`, `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`, `[click](javascript:alert(1))`,
   `![alt](https://example.com/pic.png)`. No dialog ever appears; the script and img tags
   are displayed **as literal text**; the image is a `[image: alt]` placeholder with no
   network request (check devtools Network); and clicking the link does nothing — no
   navigation, no new window, and the anchor has no `href` in the inspector. This is the
   security contract of the markdown viewer: this WebView holds the `dispatch`/`fs_*` IPC,
   so file-borne HTML must never reach the DOM.
9. **Locked-down distro** — repeat items 1–4 in a workspace whose distro has `automount`
   and `interop` disabled in `/etc/wsl.conf` (then `wsl --shutdown`): the viewers still
   work. File access runs Windows→WSL over `\\wsl.localhost`, the direction those settings
   do not gate (계획 v2 section 5).
10. **No edit affordance anywhere** — no viewer offers any way to change the file: no
    editable field, no rename/delete/save control, typing into a focused text or markdown
    view does nothing, and the only file-scoped controls are the text viewer's window
    movement buttons and the markdown viewer's **open as text** button (both read-only).
11. **Terminals stay alive across viewer switches** — start a long-running command (e.g.
    `top`) in a terminal tab, switch to a viewer tab in the same pane and back: the
    terminal is exactly where it was and still running, with **no replay flash** and no
    re-attach. Mounting a viewer must not disturb the keep-alive terminal views.
12. **Unconfigured distro resolves automatically** — with **no** workspace distro and
    **no** `WINMUX_DISTRO` (section 4), open a folder browser and a text file: both work,
    because the glue falls back to the WSL default distro (`wsl.exe -l -q`, cached for the
    process lifetime). Then set `WINMUX_DISTRO` to a second installed distro, restart, and
    confirm the viewers read **that** distro's filesystem. If every resolution path fails
    (e.g. no distro installed), the inline banner must say so loudly and name the fix
    (workspace distro or `WINMUX_DISTRO`) — never a silently empty listing.

### Post-checkpoint-2 fixes and keyboard-first UX — re-verification

Checkpoint 2 (2026-08-09) passed except three field defects; the fixes below plus the
keyboard-first UX batch need one focused re-verification round. Pull, run
`npm install` (no new runtime deps, but the lockfile moved), delete
`scripts/wsl/*.sh` and `git checkout -- scripts` once so the new `.gitattributes`
(`*.sh text eol=lf`) re-materializes them with LF endings, then rebuild.

1. **Hook auto-provisioning + tty fallback** — the hooks are no longer wired by hand: on
   launch the app streams a setup script into `wsl.exe [-d <distro>] -- bash -s` once per
   distro (contract and manual fallback:
   [`scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md`](../scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md)). Start
   the app on a distro that has never run it and check, inside WSL:
   `~/.winmux/bin/winmux-notify.sh` exists and is executable, `~/.winmux/setup.log` lists
   what happened, `~/.winmux/.setup-v2` exists, and `~/.claude/settings.json` now carries
   the `UserPromptSubmit`/`Notification`/`Stop` hooks **with every pre-existing setting
   intact**. Then run a real Claude Code session: running → needsInput → idle must route
   as before, with no `/dev/tty: No such device or address` in the hook's stderr (the
   canonical script tries `/dev/tty` first and then walks up to 8 ancestor processes for a
   `/dev/pts/*` fd — the approach you field-tested, formalized). Also confirm:
   - **idempotence** — restart the app: `setup.log` gains no new lines and
     `settings.json` is unchanged (the marker short-circuits the whole script).
   - **already-wired hooks are left alone** — with a hand-wired hook still in place, the
     provisioner adds nothing for that event (no double OSC per prompt). (This round ran
     against setup v2. Since **v3** — marker `~/.winmux/.setup-v3` — a hook that runs a
     `winmux-notify.sh` from another path is *migrated* onto `~/.winmux/bin/` instead of
     merely being skipped; still never duplicated. See the provision v3 section below.)
   - **new distro on demand** — create a workspace pinned to a second distro (section 4):
     that distro gets provisioned right after the workspace is created, without a restart.
   - **[conditional] Codex** — on a distro with `~/.codex/config.toml`, a root-level
     `notify` appears (or, if the file already had one, it is untouched and `setup.log`
     says so); finishing a Codex turn then shows `idle` in the sidebar.
2. **Markdown polling stops while minimized** — open a markdownViewer tab, minimize the
   window: `fs_stat` polling must stop within one 2s cycle (verify by appending to the
   file while minimized — no re-render happens until restore). Restore: polling resumes
   and the change lands within ~2-4s. Also confirm **no false positives**: dragging the
   window edge to resize and focusing another window (winmux still visible) must NOT stop
   polling — the live-preview-while-editing-elsewhere flow depends on it. (The minimize
   signal is a 0x0-Resized heuristic that cannot be checked on the Linux host.)
3. **Shell scripts run directly** — `bash scripts/wsl/osc-test.sh` works without the
   `sed 's/\r$//'` workaround after the re-checkout above.
4. **Global shortcuts** — `Ctrl+Shift+W` (close active tab, viewer tabs included; on the
   last empty pane it is a quiet no-op), `Ctrl+Shift+T` (new terminal tab),
   `Ctrl+Shift+D` (split top/bottom), `Ctrl+Shift+E` (split left/right),
   `Ctrl+Shift+B` (folder browser tab), `Ctrl+Shift+N` (focus the sidebar's new-workspace
   name input). Each must act **and** leave nothing in the terminal. These are Chromium
   accelerator combos (incognito/reopen-tab/bookmarks-bar/bookmark) — WebView2 usually
   lacks those features, but if any key does nothing at all, record it: the follow-up is
   `AreBrowserAcceleratorKeysEnabled(false)` or a rebinding.
5. **Tooltips show shortcuts** — hovering the pane-header buttons (`+`, `▤`, split pair),
   the tab `×`, and the sidebar's new-workspace button shows the function plus its
   shortcut (single source: `keys.ts shortcutLabel`).
6. **Folder browser keyboard navigation** — with the folder list focused: arrows move the
   selection highlight, `Home`/`End` jump, `PgUp`/`PgDn` move by 10, `Enter` opens the
   selected row (directory navigates, file opens a viewer), `Backspace` goes to the
   parent. `Alt+arrows` must still move pane focus (the view only consumes unmodified
   keys). Verify a mouse click moves the selection too, and that keyboard navigation
   still works right after opening a directory by mouse.
7. **Text viewer windows by keyboard** — with the text view focused: `Ctrl+PgUp`/
   `Ctrl+PgDn` move one 512KiB window, `Ctrl+Home`/`Ctrl+End` jump to the first/last
   window, plain `PgUp`/`PgDn` page by whole lines (no half-cut top line). Window buttons
   disable at the ends (first/prev at offset 0, next/last on the last window) and their
   tooltips name the shortcuts. **Last-line fix**: `Ctrl+End` on a large file must show
   the file's actual last line (a read-length bug used to make it unreachable).
8. **Window restore keeps context** — scroll mid-file in a >512KiB file, restart: the
   same top line is visible **and** you can scroll upward within the window (the window
   is now centered on the saved offset instead of starting at it).
9. **Per-tab shell history** — run distinct commands in two terminal tabs, restart the
   app: each respawned tab's `history` (and up-arrow) shows only its own tab's commands
   (`~/.winmux/history/tab-<id>` in the distro). Then close a tab normally and restart:
   report whether its history survived — bash writes `HISTFILE` on exit, and if the kill
   path skips it we need a `history -a` follow-up.
10. **Reload-while-minimized edge (known, accept)** — if the WebView reloads while the
    window is minimized (auto-reset), polling resumes until the next minimize/restore
    cycle. Accepted narrow window; no action needed unless it bites in practice.
11. **UI cleanup (display only — no feature was removed)** — the top status line is now
    ephemeral: at rest it is collapsed entirely (no `workspace: … · panes: … · rev …`
    log, and the terminal area starts right below the title bar). It appears only while
    send-mode is armed (the prompt) or for a dispatch error (red, gone after ~5s), and
    collapses again afterwards. Sidebar cards are three lines — name (+ unread dot, ×) /
    status text (`running` / `needs input` / `idle`, followed by ` — <last agent message>`
    when there is one, `needs input` being the only accented one) / abbreviated path;
    no more `⚡`/`🔔` icons, pane/tab counts, or branch field. Pane headers no longer show
    the `#<id>` label or the permanently disabled `◎` browser button — the unread `●`
    badge and the six working buttons (`+ ▤ ⤷ ⤷⏎ ◫ ⊟`) stay, with their tooltips intact.
12. **Rename migration (`wmux` → `winmux`)** — the project was renamed (the old name
    collided with an unrelated existing project). This is a one-time, single-developer
    migration handled by hand, not by migration code. On the Windows checkout:
    - **Remote** — GitHub redirects the old repository URL, but update it explicitly:
      `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:sjkwon-1023/winmux.git`. The local folder
      name is free (rename it to `winmux` or leave it — nothing reads it).
    - **App state (do this or you boot fresh)** — the Tauri identifier changed from
      `app.wmux.desktop` to `app.winmux.desktop`, so the state directory moved. Rename
      `%APPDATA%\app.wmux.desktop` to `%APPDATA%\app.winmux.desktop` and the existing
      workspaces/panes/tabs restore exactly as before. Skip it and the app boots with an
      empty state — nothing is lost, the data just sits in the old folder until you move
      it. (The spike's identifier moved `app.wmux.spike` → `app.winmux.spike` the same
      way, but it persists nothing.)
    - **Environment variables** — every `WMUX_*` knob is now `WINMUX_*`. If you had
      `WMUX_DISTRO` set (section 4), set `WINMUX_DISTRO` instead — the old name is no
      longer read, and a stale one silently does nothing. Same for any `WMUX_RESET_*` /
      `WMUX_OSC_FLUSH_MS` you set for the section 9 checks.
    - **Claude Code hooks** — the OSC status token is now `winmux:running` /
      `winmux:needsInput` / `winmux:idle`. Auto-provisioning (item 1) wires the new hooks
      for you, but it never edits an entry that is already there, so a leftover `wmux:*`
      hook has to be **deleted by hand** from `~/.claude/settings.json`; until it is, it
      keeps landing as a status-neutral notification (unread dot, no status change) on top
      of the new ones. The contract is
      [`scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md`](../scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md).
    - **Shell history in WSL** — `mv ~/.wmux ~/.winmux` in the distro keeps every tab's
      history (item 9). Without it each respawned tab starts with an empty history.

### Post re-verification polish — verification

The re-verification round above passed in full on 2026-08-10. The batch below landed
right after it: a `Shift+Enter` rewrite for agents, a sidebar reflow fix, a folder-first
new-workspace flow, and a surface cleanup (send buttons retired, icons redrawn). Rebuild
and check these; nothing here needs a fresh `npm install`.

1. **`Shift+Enter` inserts a newline in Claude Code** — in a terminal tab running Claude
   Code, type a word, press `Shift+Enter`: the prompt must grow a second line instead of
   submitting. Plain `Enter` still submits. The terminal now emits `ESC CR` for that
   combo itself, so this must work **without** running Claude Code's `/terminal-setup`.
   Then confirm it is harmless everywhere else: at a bash prompt `Shift+Enter` must
   behave like a normal `Enter` (runs the line / gives a fresh prompt — no stray escape
   character left on the line), and in `vim` insert mode it must still open a new line.
2. **Sidebar width never moves** — with a workspace whose card shows a long status line
   (run a Claude Code session so the status becomes `needs input — <a long agent
   message>`), watch the sidebar's right edge across `running` → `needs input` → `idle`
   transitions: it must stay pinned at 220px and the terminal area must not reflow. Long
   text is cut with an ellipsis on each of the card's three lines. Also drag the window
   narrower and confirm the sidebar still holds its width.
3. **Folder pick creates the workspace immediately** — the sidebar's new-workspace button
   opens the Windows folder dialog directly; there is no name field to fill in any more.
   Picking a folder creates the workspace **in one step** (name = folder name, root path =
   the converted Linux path) with a terminal tab already in it, and the new tab's shell
   starts in that directory (`pwd`). Cancelling the dialog does nothing at all (no error,
   no empty workspace). Verify both path shapes:
   - **WSL filesystem (UNC)** — pick something under `\\wsl.localhost\<distro>\home\...`:
     the workspace root must come out as the plain Linux path (`/home/...`) and the tab
     must run in **that distro** even when it is not the default one.
   - **Windows drive is refused** — pick e.g. `C:\Users\<you>\code`: the status line must
     show a clear error ("Windows drives cannot host a workspace ...") and **no** workspace
     may appear. Drives are data-only by decision (2026-08-11) — browse them with the folder
     viewer instead. The core enforces the same rule (`/mnt` roots are rejected even via the
     dev hook), so nothing can slip through another path.
   - **Rejected paths** — create one from inside WSL (`mkdir '/tmp/badname.'` — note the
     trailing dot), then pick it through the UNC view: the status line must show a loud
     path error and **no** workspace may appear. Trailing dot/space and `\` in names are
     refused on purpose — the same rule the viewer tabs use, so a bad name can never be
     assembled into a different Windows path than the one you clicked. (Do **not** test
     this with a `:` name: the 9P server shows `:` to Windows as a private-use character,
     so the picked path contains no literal `:` and passes validation — the name would
     fail later, at spawn/cwd time, which is acceptable but is not this item.)
4. **`Ctrl+Shift+N` creates a workspace from the current directory** — `cd` somewhere in a
   terminal (with the OSC 7 prompt snippet wired the live directory is used; without it, the
   spawn-time directory), press `Ctrl+Shift+N`: a workspace rooted there appears
   immediately, named after the folder, same distro — **no dialog**. In a directory under
   `/mnt` it must refuse with a status-line error instead (drives are data-only). With no
   workspace open at all it falls back to the folder picker. Nothing may leak into the
   terminal. The sidebar `+` button still opens the picker for arbitrary folders.
5. **`F2` renames the active workspace** — press `F2`: the active sidebar card's name
   turns into an inline text box, pre-filled and fully selected. `Enter` commits; `Esc`
   **and** clicking away both cancel and restore the old name. An all-whitespace name is
   refused — the box stays open and focused instead of sending anything. Committing an
   unchanged name sends nothing. While the box has focus, typing must land in the box and
   not in the terminal.
   Known trade-off: `F2` no longer reaches TUI apps (e.g. `mc`'s Rename) — confirm that
   is the only casualty and that `F1`/`F3`… still reach the terminal.
6. **`Ctrl+Shift+[` / `Ctrl+Shift+]` cycle workspaces** — with three or more workspaces,
   `]` moves to the next in sidebar order and wraps at the end, `[` moves back and wraps
   at the start; with a single workspace both are quiet no-ops. Check them on a keyboard
   layout where `[`/`]` need no modifier and, if you have one handy, on a layout where
   they do — both the bare characters and their shifted forms (`{`/`}`) are matched.
7. **Send buttons are gone** — the pane header now has exactly four buttons: new terminal
   tab, folder browser tab, and the two splits. The `⤷` / `⤷⏎` pair and its
   target-selection mode (crosshair cursor, status-line prompt, `Esc` to cancel) are
   **retired**, so `Esc` now always belongs to the terminal: press `Esc` in `vim` and it
   must leave insert mode on the first press. Clicking a pane always just focuses it.
   Selection + `Ctrl+Shift+C` copy is untouched. (Agent-facing text passing returns in v2
   as a designed channel, not as a manual button.)
8. **Redrawn icons** — the pane header's folder button is now a drawn folder outline, and
   the two split buttons are a matched pair: one rectangle split by a **vertical** line
   (left/right) and the same rectangle split by a **horizontal** line (top/bottom). At a
   glance it must be obvious which is which; click each and confirm the split direction
   matches its picture. The icons must inherit the header's text colour (including the
   hover background) and stay crisp at the OS display scaling you use. Tooltips still
   read `<function> (<shortcut>)`.
9. **App icon** — the exe, its taskbar button, the window's title-bar corner and
   `Alt+Tab` must all show the new icon: a blue `W` on a near-black square. Check it at
   small sizes too (taskbar, 16px file-explorer list view) — the `W` must stay readable,
   not a blue smudge. If Explorer still shows the old icon after a rebuild it is the
   Windows icon cache, not the build: `ie4uinit.exe -show` or a fresh folder view.

### Agent send channel — verification

The agent-facing pane-to-pane send channel (`OSC 777;winmux-send`; contract in
[`scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md`](../scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md), agent-side
instructions in `scripts/wsl/skills/winmux-send/SKILL.md`). Run the app from a console
(`npm run tauri dev`) so its stderr is visible — every failure of this channel is logged
there and **nowhere else**.

Open two terminal tabs. In the one that will receive text, set a title; in the other, send.

```bash
# receiver
printf '\033]0;build\007'
# sender
printf '\033]777;winmux-send;build;'"$(printf '%s\n' 'echo delivered' | base64 -w0)"'\007' > /dev/tty
```

1. **Delivery** — `echo delivered` appears in the receiver **and runs** (the payload carries
   the trailing newline). The sender's own screen shows nothing at all: no echo of the
   sequence, no confirmation, no error.
2. **Off screen still arrives; another workspace does not** — first the reach: in the
   receiver's pane switch to a different tab so the receiver sits in the background, and send
   again. The text must still arrive (switch back to check) — this is the point of the
   channel, it does not go through the frontend. Then the boundary: move the receiver to a
   **second workspace** and send from the first. **Nothing may arrive**, addressed by title or
   by `#<id>` alike, and the app's stderr reports no match (workspace confinement, user
   decision 2026-08-11 — a workspace is the project isolation unit, so the channel stops at
   it).
3. **Ambiguity refuses to fire** — title a third tab `build-2` and send to `build` again:
   **neither** tab may receive anything, and the app's stderr says how many matched. Retitle
   it, confirm delivery resumes.
4. **No match** — send to `nosuchtab`: nothing arrives anywhere, stderr says so.
5. **Self-send is impossible** — title the sender itself `build` while the receiver keeps
   that title too: the send still lands in the receiver (the sender is excluded, so the
   match stays unique). With the receiver closed, sending to `build` from the sender must
   deliver nothing.
6. **Bad payloads are rejected** — send with a non-base64 body
   (`printf '\033]777;winmux-send;build;not base64!\007' > /dev/tty`) and with a huge one
   (`head -c 200000 /dev/zero | base64 -w0`): nothing arrives, the sender is unaffected, and
   the oversize case is discarded without a log line — the decoder refuses anything over the
   32 KiB text contract, and OSC payloads over 64 KiB never even reach the parser.
7. **Notifications still work** — with the send channel exercised, run a Claude Code session
   in one of the tabs and confirm the section 10 item 1 statuses (`running` → `needsInput` →
   `idle`) still route as before: adding `winmux-send` must not disturb the `notify` contract.
8. **Skill is installed** — inside WSL, `~/.claude/skills/winmux-send/SKILL.md` exists after
   the app has provisioned the distro (it is installed by the same setup script, marker
   `~/.winmux/.setup-v3`), and a Claude Code session in a winmux tab can find it by name.

### Agent integration on real hardware (provision v3) — re-verification

Found on the machine after checkpoint 2: the hooks a user had wired by hand still pointed at
their own `~/.claude/hooks/winmux-notify.sh`, so the newer provisioned script never ran; an
agent had no way to tell it was inside winmux; and the send channel had to be re-derived from
the raw escape sequence every time. Setup version 3 (`~/.winmux/.setup-v3`) addresses all
three, and the last two items below cover the front-end half of the same batch.

The v3 marker differs from v2, so **an already-provisioned distro re-provisions on the next
launch** — no manual cleanup. Run the app from a console so its stderr is visible.

1. **Hooks are migrated onto the provisioned script** — before launching, note what
   `~/.claude/settings.json` has (a hand-wired setup points at `~/.claude/hooks/…`). Launch
   the app once, then check:
   - all three of `UserPromptSubmit` / `Notification` / `Stop` now run
     `"$HOME/.winmux/bin/winmux-notify.sh"`, with the **arguments unchanged** (`winmux:running`,
     `winmux:needsInput 'needs input'`, `winmux:idle done` — or your customised bodies),
   - **no event has two winmux hooks**, and every hook that is not ours (other tools, other
     events such as `PreToolUse`) is byte-for-byte as it was,
   - `~/.winmux/setup.log` names what happened per event — `migrated` / `added` /
     `already wired` — and `~/.winmux/.setup-v3` exists,
   - launching again changes nothing (the marker short-circuits; deleting the marker and
     relaunching must log `already wired` and leave the file untouched).
   Then run a Claude Code session in a tab and confirm the section 10 item 1 statuses still
   route (`running` → `needs input` → `idle`): the migration is only worth anything if the
   migrated path actually fires. The old `~/.claude/hooks/winmux-notify.sh` is left on disk
   on purpose — nothing references it any more; delete it by hand if you want it gone.
2. **`winmux-send.sh` sends without hand-assembling the sequence** — title one tab
   (`printf '\033]0;build\007'`) and from another tab:
   ```bash
   ~/.winmux/bin/winmux-send.sh build 'echo delivered'      # arrives and runs
   ~/.winmux/bin/winmux-send.sh -l build 'echo prefilled'   # arrives, waits at the prompt
   ~/.winmux/bin/winmux-send.sh nosuchtab hi; echo "exit=$?" # nothing arrives, exit=0, silent
   ~/.winmux/bin/winmux-send.sh build; echo "exit=$?"        # usage error on stderr, exit=2
   ```
   The sending pane must show no echo of the sequence and no confirmation for the deliveries.
   Then have a **Claude Code session** in a tab call the helper (ask the agent to send
   something to `build` — the `winmux-send` skill now points it here): it must arrive from
   the agent's tool context too, which is the case that has no controlling TTY.
3. **A tab knows it is winmux** — in a fresh terminal tab, `echo "$WINMUX / $WINMUX_TAB"`
   prints `1 / <number>`. The number is that tab's id: it is stable across an app restart
   for the same tab, and two tabs never share one. It must survive into child processes
   (`bash -c 'echo $WINMUX_TAB'`, and a Claude Code session's Bash tool). Existing per-tab
   history keeps working — the same wrapper sets `HISTFILE` — so check that a restarted tab
   still recalls its own history with the up arrow.
4. **Codex's input box is legible** — run `codex` in a tab: its composer box border, the
   separator line above it and the dim placeholder text must all be clearly distinguishable
   from the terminal background (the failure this fixes was a TUI that dissolved into the
   background). Check the same for another TUI you have handy (`htop`, `mc`) so the palette
   is not merely tuned to one app, and confirm normal ANSI colours in `ls`/`git diff` still
   look right.
5. **The needs-input chime** *(historical — the chime was removed in v0.3.7; run §10 v0.3.7
   item 2 instead on any current build)* — with the app focused, click or press a key once (the audio
   context unlocks on the first gesture), then run a Claude Code session and let it ask a
   question: a short two-tone chime plays **once** as the workspace turns `needs input`.
   Then confirm the quiet cases: no sound on `running` or `idle`, no repeat while it stays
   at `needs input`, and none at all on app start when a restored workspace is already at
   `needs input`. With two workspaces going to `needs input` in the same snapshot it must
   still be a single chime. The sound is synthesised in the WebView, so nothing needs to be
   installed; if it does not play at all, check that the first-gesture unlock happened (the
   dev console logs a debug line when the audio context is unavailable).

### Query channel + winmux CLI, workspace-scoped (provision v5) — verification

The agent channel gained a read half (`OSC 777;winmux-query`, contract in
[`scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md`](../scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md)) and a single
CLI in front of both halves, and **both halves are confined to the requester's own workspace**
(user decision 2026-08-11). Setup version 5 (`~/.winmux/.setup-v5`) installs
`~/.winmux/bin/winmux`, turns the v3 `winmux-send.sh` into a wrapper around `winmux send`, and
rewrites the `winmux-send` skill around the CLI with the workspace-scoped rules. The v5 marker
differs from v4, so **an already-provisioned distro re-provisions on the next launch** — no
manual cleanup. Run the app from a console (`npm run tauri dev`) so its stderr is visible:
every failure of these channels is logged there and **nowhere else**.

1. **The CLI is installed and on `PATH`** — in a **new** terminal tab (an existing tab was
   spawned by the previous build and has the old environment):
   ```bash
   command -v winmux      # /home/<you>/.winmux/bin/winmux — no path needed
   winmux id              # this tab's id, the same number as $WINMUX_TAB
   winmux --help          # three usage lines plus the addressing and COMMAND notes
   ```
   Confirm `~/.winmux/.setup-v5` exists and `~/.winmux/setup.log` names the CLI install, and
   that per-tab history still works (up arrow recalls this tab's own history — the same
   wrapper sets `PATH` and `HISTFILE`, so a mistake there breaks both).
2. **`winmux ls` lists this workspace's tabs and no others** — open several tabs across
   **two workspaces**, give a couple of them titles (`printf '\033]0;build\007'`), open a
   viewer tab (a folder or a markdown file), and let one tab's terminal exit. Then from a tab
   in each workspace in turn:
   ```bash
   winmux ls
   ```
   - every tab **of the workspace you ran it in** appears, grouped pane → tab, including tabs
     that are not the ones currently on screen,
   - **no tab of the other workspace appears** — run it from both sides and confirm the two
     tables are disjoint,
   - `STATUS` is `running` / `exited` / `viewer` and matches what the tabs actually are,
   - the row for the tab you ran it in carries `*` in the `TAB` column,
   - `WORKSPACE` shows your own workspace's name, the same on every row.
   The sending pane shows no escape sequence and no stray output — only the table.
3. **The `COMMAND` column** — in one tab start something long-running (`sleep 300`, `htop`,
   a Claude Code session) and leave another sitting at its prompt, then run `winmux ls` from a
   third:
   - the busy tab names the command, the idle tab shows `-`,
   - a tab running in **another WSL distro** (make a workspace with a different distro) shows
     `?`, and so does a tab running a Windows shell — this is the documented limit of reading
     `/proc` from one distro, not a bug,
   - an `exited` tab and a viewer tab show `-` (nothing runs in them by definition).
4. **`#<id>` addressing beats titles** — give **two** tabs the same title (`build`), then:
   ```bash
   winmux send build 'echo ambiguous'   # nothing arrives; stderr says how many matched
   winmux send '#181' 'echo by id'      # arrives in tab 181 only, and runs
   winmux send -l '#181' 'echo literal' # arrives, waits at the prompt
   winmux send '#999999' hi             # nothing arrives anywhere, silent, exit 0
   ```
   Take the ids from `winmux ls`. Quoting matters — an unquoted `#181` is a shell comment.
   Send to the id of the **viewer** tab and of the **exited** tab: both must deliver nothing.
   Send to your own id: nothing arrives (self-exclusion). Finally take an id from the **other
   workspace** (read it from a `winmux ls` run over there, since your own listing no longer
   shows it) and send to it: nothing arrives either — a globally unique id is still not a key
   past the workspace boundary.
5. **The old helper still works** — `~/.winmux/bin/winmux-send.sh build 'echo compat'` and its
   `-l` form behave exactly as in the v3 round above; the file is now two lines.
6. **Timeout outside winmux** — in a plain WSL terminal (Windows Terminal, not winmux):
   ```bash
   ~/.winmux/bin/winmux ls; echo "exit=$?"
   ```
   After ~2s it must print `no reply from winmux (not inside winmux, or the app is an old
   version)` on stderr and exit 1, printing no table. Then confirm the same for the mismatched
   pair: run this **new** CLI while an **older winmux build** (one without the query channel)
   is the app — same message, same 2s, and the older app's stderr shows nothing, because an
   unknown OSC kind is simply not parsed. Check `ls /tmp/winmux-query-*` afterwards in both
   cases: **no leftover files**, and none with a `.partial` suffix.
7. **The reply file is cleaned up and never half-read** — run `winmux ls` in a loop
   (`for i in $(seq 20); do winmux ls > /dev/null || echo FAIL; done`) and confirm every run
   succeeds and `/tmp` has no `winmux-query-*` left behind. Then run two `winmux ls` at the
   same time from two tabs: both must get their own complete table (the query is not
   coalesced, and each names its own reply file).
8. **Nothing else regressed** — with the channels exercised, run a Claude Code session in a
   tab and confirm the section 10 item 1 statuses (`running` → `needsInput` → `idle`) still
   route, and that the agent finds the rewritten skill by name and uses `winmux ls` →
   `winmux send '#<id>'` on its own when asked to hand work to another pane.

### v0.3.1 + v0.3.2 — verification

Six items: the OSC 10/11 colour-query responder, the workspace confinement of the agent
channel, terminal font settings, the new-workspace button unification, the Codex AGENTS.md
guidance, and — added in v0.3.2 — the per-tab agent resume hint. Run the app from a console
(`npm run tauri dev`) — item 1 is decided by a line on the app's **stderr**, and nothing else
reports it. Setup version **6** (`~/.winmux/.setup-v6`) carries the v0.3.2 notify script, and
the marker differs from v5, so **an already-provisioned distro re-provisions on the next
launch**; the wrapper half reaches only tabs opened after this build, so item 6 needs new tabs.

1. **Codex's input box** — **CLOSED 2026-08-12 as out-of-app.** The release-side probe
   returned an empty reply on the field machine: conhost consumes the OSC 11 query and
   answers no one (not even from its own table), so neither the in-app responder nor the
   THEME_SYNC set can reach Codex's background probe. Upstream tracking:
   openai/codex#19741 (composer pill lost when the color query is blocked). The
   responder and THEME_SYNC stay — they cost nothing and cover conhost versions that do
   forward or answer. Original item kept below for machines where the probe answers.

1. (original) **Codex's input box** — open a **new** tab (an existing tab predates this build) and start
   `codex`. The input prompt must be drawn as a filled pill that separates from the terminal
   background, not as bare text on the background.

   Whatever the screen shows, decide by one of two signals. **A release exe has no
   console, so its stderr is invisible** — there, run the probe inside a winmux tab
   instead: `old=$(stty -g); stty raw -echo min 0 time 5; printf '\033]11;?\033\\';
   resp=$(dd bs=64 count=1 2>/dev/null); stty "$old"; printf '%s\n' "$resp" | cat -v` —
   an `^[]11;rgb:1e1e/...` reply means the query path works (responder or xterm
   answered); an empty reply means conhost consumed the query and the item closes as
   out-of-app. In a dev run (`npm run tauri dev`) the stderr line is the same signal:
   - `[winmux] color query 11 answered (session=<n>)` present → the query reached us and we
     answered with the theme background (`#1e1e1e`). If the pill is *still* invisible after
     that, the remaining suspect is Codex's own colour choice, not the query path. Note that
     in this world xterm.js may answer the same query too (identical value, second reply is
     an unsolicited byte burst) — re-run the earlier probe one-liner and count how many
     `rgb:` replies come back if Codex misbehaves.
   - **no such line at all** → the query never left conhost: it intercepted the sequence and
     did not pass it through, so no responder inside the app can ever see it. **That closes
     this item as an out-of-app (conhost) problem** — do not add more app-side responders.
     The `THEME_SYNC` set on spawn (`host.rs`) stays as the only lever we have there.

   The responder's reply values live in `sink.rs` (`COLOR_REPLY_FOREGROUND` /
   `COLOR_REPLY_BACKGROUND`) and are one leg of a three-way contract with `host.rs`'s
   `THEME_SYNC` and `terminal-view.ts`'s `TERMINAL_THEME` — if you retheme, all three move
   together.

2. **Workspace isolation of the agent channel** — with tabs open in **two** workspaces, run
   `winmux ls` from a tab in each:
   - each listing shows only the tabs of the workspace it was run in, and the two tables are
     disjoint,
   - take a tab id from the *other* workspace's listing and `winmux send '#<id>' 'echo x'`:
     nothing arrives there, silently (a globally unique id is still not a key past the
     workspace boundary).

   This repeats section 10's "Query channel" items 2 and 4 deliberately — it is the regression
   check that the confinement survived this batch.

3. **Terminal font from `settings.json`** — the file is written by hand; there is no settings
   UI. Create `%AppData%\app.winmux.desktop\settings.json`:
   ```json
   {"fontFamily": "Cascadia Code, Consolas, monospace", "fontSize": 15}
   ```
   Restart the app (this is read once at boot, so a reload is not enough — quit and relaunch).
   - every terminal tab, including ones restored from the saved layout, renders in that font
     and size, and `fit` still gives a sane column count (no clipped or overlapping cells),
   - remove the file and restart → back to Consolas 13, no error,
   - break the JSON (drop the closing brace) and restart → the status line briefly shows a
     `cannot parse ...settings.json` error and **the app still boots** with the default font;
     the same holds for `{"fontSize": 200}`, which reports an out-of-range fontSize (6-72).

4. **The New workspace button matches Ctrl+Shift+N** (field bug 2026-08-11) — with a
   workspace open, click the sidebar's `+ New workspace` button: a workspace rooted at the
   active terminal's current directory appears immediately, **no folder dialog**. The dialog
   appears in exactly one situation: pressing either entry point when **no workspace exists
   at all** (first boot) — then there is no "current directory" to use.

5. **Codex sandbox guidance (`~/.codex/AGENTS.md`)** — after this build's provisioning runs
   (marker `.setup-v6`), `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` in the distro contains the managed
   `winmux integration` block (only when `~/.codex` already existed). Ask Codex to run
   `winmux ls`: it should request escalated/non-sandboxed execution per the guidance —
   sandboxed runs fail silently because the sandbox blocks the terminal device and mounts a
   private `/tmp`. Any text of yours outside the managed block must be untouched.

6. **Agent resume hint across a restart** (v0.3.2; contract in
   [`scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md`](../scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md), "Resume
   hint") — this needs the new provisioning *and* a new tab, so launch this build once to let
   it re-provision (confirm `~/.winmux/.setup-v6` exists), then open a **fresh** terminal tab.
   ```bash
   echo "$WINMUX_TAB"        # the tab id the file below is named after
   claude                    # ask it anything, so the hooks fire at least once
   ```
   - while that session runs, `cat ~/.winmux/resume/tab-$WINMUX_TAB` shows two lines: a
     `claude --resume <uuid>` command and an epoch timestamp. Ask a second question and check
     that the timestamp moves — it is rewritten on every hook call,
   - **quit winmux and relaunch it.** The tab comes back as a fresh shell, and just above the
     first prompt sits one dimmed line: `[winmux] resume previous agent: claude --resume <uuid>`,
   - press **↑ once** at that prompt: the same command is on the command line, unrun. Nothing
     was executed on your behalf — confirm the tab is at a plain prompt, not inside Claude.
     Press Enter and the session comes back with its history,
   - open a **different** new tab (one that never ran an agent) and confirm it prints **no**
     hint line at all, and that ↑ there recalls that tab's own history as before,
   - start a **second, different** Claude session in the first tab, restart again, and confirm
     the hint names the newer session — the most recent one wins.
   Note: recording starts with the **first hook event after this build's provisioning**
   (v6) — a session that ran before the update left no record, so the very first restart
   after updating shows no hint yet. Run one prompt through Claude first, then restart.

   The hint is shown whenever the file exists, no matter how old it is (freshness is your
   call, and line 2 is there to check by hand). Codex sessions were not recorded in this
   version; they are as of v0.3.5 (setup v7) — see that checklist below.

### v0.3.4 — verification

The v0.3.4 backlog batch. Items are independent — run them in any order on a build of this
batch, from a console (`npm run tauri dev`) unless an item says otherwise.

1. **Terminal zoom — `Ctrl+=` / `Ctrl++` / `Ctrl+-` / `Ctrl+0`** (session-only by decision;
   the interception rows and the trade-off note live in the
   [`apps/winmux/src/keys.ts`](../apps/winmux/src/keys.ts) module doc).
   - **All tabs move together** — with at least two panes and two tabs per pane, press
     `Ctrl+=` a few times: the visible terminals grow in step, and switching to the hidden
     tabs shows them at the same size (they refit on becoming visible, not before). A tab
     opened *after* zooming opens at the zoomed size — no per-tab font divergence anywhere
     in the window, including tabs restored in another workspace.
   - **The `+` key works as `+`** — on a US layout the zoom-in key is physically `Shift+=`;
     pressing `Ctrl` + the key labelled `+` must zoom in, not do nothing.
   - **Clamp** — hold `Ctrl+=` and let auto-repeat run past the top: the size stops at 72px
     and stays there (no error, no runaway growth, the app stays responsive). Same at the
     bottom with `Ctrl+-` → 6px. These bounds are the same range the backend enforces for
     `settings.json` (`FONT_SIZE_RANGE` 6-72 in `commands.rs`); a size reachable by zoom but
     rejected in the file would mean the two drifted apart.
   - **Reset goes to *your* default, not the app default** — write
     `%AppData%\app.winmux.desktop\settings.json` with `{"fontSize": 15}` and relaunch; zoom
     away from it, then `Ctrl+0` → back to **15**, not 13. Remove the file, relaunch, and
     `Ctrl+0` lands on 13.
   - **Session-only** — after zooming, quit and relaunch: terminals come back at the
     `settings.json` size (or 13), and the file's contents/timestamp are untouched. The app
     never writes zoom back.
   - **Nothing leaks into the terminal** — at a shell prompt with an empty command line,
     press all four combinations: the font changes and the command line stays **empty** (no
     stray `=`, `-`, `0`, `+`). Repeat inside a TUI (`htop`, `vim`) — the keys zoom and the
     app underneath does not see them.
   - **The grid really refit** — after a zoom, `tput cols; tput lines` reports the new grid
     (the PTY got the resize, not just the renderer), and a full-screen TUI redraws filling
     the pane with no clipped or overlapping columns.
   - **The accepted trade-off: `C-_` is no longer the shell's** — in `bash`, `Ctrl+-` /
     `Ctrl+_` used to be undo on the command line. Type a few words, press `Ctrl+-`, and
     confirm the font shrinks **and the undo does not happen**. This is intended (same class
     as `Ctrl+1`-`Ctrl+9`); if it proves too costly in the field, the fix is to drop the row
     from the keys.ts table, not to special-case it. `Ctrl+Shift+-` is *not* intercepted, so
     whatever that sends still reaches the shell.
   - **`Ctrl+0` is not a workspace switch** — with several workspaces open, `Ctrl+0` only
     resets the font (workspace ordinals stay `Ctrl+1`-`Ctrl+9`).

2. **needsInput toast — fires only while the window is unfocused.** *(Historical: v0.3.7
   replaced this rule and removed the chime — a focused window now still toasts for workspaces
   it is not showing, and nothing makes a sound. Run §10 v0.3.7 item 2 on any current build.)*
   The chime already covers
   the focused case; the toast exists for the moment winmux is *not* the window you are
   looking at. It rides the same onset rule as the chime
   ([`apps/winmux/src/chime.ts`](../apps/winmux/src/chime.ts), `detectNeedsInputOnset`), so
   drive it the same way: let an agent (Claude Code) reach a state where it waits for you —
   a permission prompt is the easiest.
   - **Unfocused → toast** — click another window (an editor, Explorer) so winmux loses
     focus, then let the agent hit needsInput. A Windows toast appears bottom-right with the
     title `winmux — <workspace name>` and, as the body, the **first line** of the agent's
     last message; with no message recorded the body reads `agent needs your input`. The
     workspace name is the point of the notification — it is how you know which project is
     waiting.
   - **Focused → no toast, chime only** — repeat with winmux focused (click into a terminal
     first): the chime plays and the sidebar highlights, but **no toast appears**. A toast
     on top of the window you are already reading is noise, so this half is as much of a
     requirement as the first.
   - **One toast per workspace, one chime per batch** — with two workspaces entering
     needsInput in the same snapshot while unfocused, expect two toasts and a single chime.
     Staying in needsInput (later redraws, tab activity) produces neither — only the rising
     transition notifies.
   - **Sender identity for an unsigned standalone exe** *(field item — report what you see)*
     — the toast is issued under the bundle identifier `app.winmux.desktop`, and Windows
     resolves the displayed sender from an installed app registration. A standalone,
     unsigned, never-installed `winmux-app.exe` may therefore show a generic or missing
     sender, and may land in the Action Center under an odd name. Note the exact sender text
     and whether the toast reaches the Action Center at all; if it looks wrong, report it
     rather than working around it — the fix would be a registration/shortcut question, not
     an app-code one.
   - **Failure stays silent by design** — if notifications are turned off for the app
     (Settings → System → Notifications) or Focus Assist swallows them, nothing else may
     break: the chime still plays, the UI keeps working, and the only trace is a
     `console.debug` line (`needsInput toast failed`) in the dev console. Confirm that, and
     treat it as correct behavior rather than a defect — the toast is an auxiliary signal,
     same discipline as the chime.

### v0.3.5 — verification

**Codex gets the resume hint.** Setup version **7** (`~/.winmux/.setup-v7`) installs
`~/.winmux/bin/winmux-codex-notify.sh` and points Codex's `notify` at it, so a Codex thread
is recorded per tab exactly as a Claude Code session already was
([`scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md`](../scripts/wsl/claude-hook-example.md), "Resume
hint"). Run these in a distro that has Codex installed, on a build of this version.

1. **Provisioning replaced winmux's own `notify` line, and only that.** Launch the app once
   and confirm `~/.winmux/.setup-v7` exists, then read `~/.codex/config.toml`: the `notify`
   value is now

   ```toml
   notify = ["bash", "-lc", 'exec "$HOME/.winmux/bin/winmux-codex-notify.sh" "$0"']
   ```

   and **everything else in the file is untouched** (model, `[tui]`, your own keys, the
   comment above the line). `~/.winmux/setup.log` says `notify upgraded to
   winmux-codex-notify.sh`. Launch again after deleting the marker and it says `already runs
   winmux-codex-notify.sh; left untouched` — the second run must not rewrite anything.

2. **A hand-written `notify` is not migrated.** In a distro where you have edited that line
   yourself (or fake it: change the wording inside the quotes, or point it at your own
   script), delete the marker and relaunch. The line is **byte-for-byte as you left it**, and
   the log says `left untouched` — with the line to paste, if the value mentions a winmux
   script. This is the rule the whole step rests on; a wrongly-rewritten user config is a
   failure of this checklist even if everything else passes.

3. **A turn records the hint.** Run `codex` in a winmux tab, let one turn complete, and check
   `~/.winmux/resume/tab-<id>` (the tab id is `winmux id`): line 1 reads `codex resume
   <uuid>`, line 2 is the epoch. The uuid should match what Codex itself prints as its resume
   hint when you exit it.

4. **The idle notification previews Codex's last message.** As the turn completes, the pane
   badge/sidebar preview shows the **first line of Codex's closing message**, not a fixed
   string — that is the visible difference from v6, which always read `codex turn complete`.
   A turn that ends with no message still notifies, with `codex turn complete` as the body.

5. **Restart offers it back.** Quit and relaunch winmux. The respawned tab prints one dimmed
   line, `[winmux] resume previous agent: codex resume <uuid>`, and a single ↑ puts that
   command on the command line. Press Enter and confirm Codex actually reopens that thread —
   the point of the hint is that the command works, not that it is printed.

6. **Alternating agents: the last one wins.** In the same tab, run Claude Code through one
   prompt, then Codex through one turn, then restart: the hint is the **Codex** one. Reverse
   the order (Codex, then Claude Code) and restart: the hint is the **Claude** one. One tab
   has one hint, and it names whichever agent spoke last.

7. **A tab with no Codex and no Claude still looks untouched.** A tab that never ran an agent
   prints no hint line at all, and ↑ recalls that tab's own history as before.

Note, as with v0.3.3: recording starts with the **first turn after this build's provisioning**
(v7). A Codex thread that ran before the update left no record, so the first restart after
updating shows no Codex hint yet — run one turn through Codex first, then restart.

### v0.3.6 — verification

The v0.3.6 batch. Items are independent — run them in any order on a build of this batch.

1. **Close the active workspace — `Ctrl+Shift+Q`** (the interception row lives in the
   [`apps/winmux/src/keys.ts`](../apps/winmux/src/keys.ts) module doc; the key runs the
   sidebar `×` button's implementation, so the two can never disagree).
   - **Confirm appears while sessions are running** — in a workspace with at least one live
     terminal (a shell prompt counts), press `Ctrl+Shift+Q`: the same dialog the `×` button
     shows appears, naming the workspace — `Close workspace "<name>"? All terminal sessions
     in it will be killed.`
   - **Cancel changes nothing** — dismiss the dialog and confirm the workspace is still
     there, still active, with its panes, tabs and scrollback intact, and the shells still
     alive (`echo $$` gives the same pid as before).
   - **Accept closes it** — confirm the dialog and the workspace card disappears, the view
     switches to whatever workspace the core makes active, and keyboard focus lands in a
     terminal there (typing goes into the shell, not nowhere).
   - **A workspace with no running sessions closes immediately** — in a workspace whose
     terminals have all exited (`exit` in each) or that only has viewer tabs, press
     `Ctrl+Shift+Q`: it closes with **no dialog** (there is nothing to kill, so the warning
     would be a lie).
   - **The last workspace behaves exactly as the `×` button does** — close the only
     remaining workspace with the key and confirm you get the same result as clicking `×`
     on it (no special-casing was added for the keyboard path).
   - **Nothing leaks into the terminal** — at a shell prompt with an empty command line,
     press `Ctrl+Shift+Q` and cancel: the command line stays **empty**. Note the shell's own
     `Ctrl+Q` (XON) is untouched — only the `Shift` variant is intercepted.
   - **The `×` tooltip advertises the key** — hover the `×` on a workspace card: the tooltip
     reads `Close workspace (Ctrl+Shift+Q)`.
   - **WebView2 delivers it** — this combo was not in the set
     [ADR-0007](adr/0007-keyboard-model.md) cleared on 2026-08-10, and `Ctrl+Shift+Q` is a
     browser quit accelerator on some platforms. The first bullet already proves delivery
     (no dialog = the WebView ate the key); if it ever regresses, the fix is
     `AreBrowserAcceleratorKeysEnabled(false)`, not a different binding.

2. **Syntax highlighting in the text viewer** — highlighting is an overlay on the existing
   plain renderer, and every item below is about it staying an overlay. Use a folder tab to
   open the files (the highlighter is chosen by extension, not by content).

   - **Plain first, colour after** — open a real `.py` or `.rs` source file of a few hundred
     lines. The text must appear **immediately**, uncoloured, and the colours arrive a moment
     later on their own; scrolling and typing elsewhere stay responsive the whole time. A
     visible wait before the text appears is a failure, not a slow machine.
   - **The colours match the app** — token colours are VS Code's dark palette on the viewer's
     own background: the background does **not** change to a lighter block, the line grid does
     not shift, and the horizontal scroll of long lines still works.
   - **Unsupported extensions stay plain** — open a `.txt`, a `.log` and a file with no
     extension at all: they render exactly as before, in one colour, with no delay.
   - **`settings.json` picks the languages** — with the app closed, write
     `%AppData%\app.winmux.desktop\settings.json` as `{"highlightLanguages": ["python"]}` and
     relaunch: a `.py` file is coloured and a `.rs` file is now plain. Change it to `[]` and
     relaunch → nothing is coloured anywhere. Remove the key (or the file) and relaunch → the
     default set is back and both files are coloured again.
   - **A bad language name reports itself** — `{"highlightLanguages": ["pyton"]}` and relaunch:
     the status line shows an `unsupported language "pyton"` error listing the supported names,
     and **the app still boots** with default fonts and default highlighting (same loud-fail
     rule as `fontSize`).
   - **Large files stay responsive** — open a source file bigger than ~256 KiB (or use the
     window buttons to page into one): the window renders immediately and stays plain — that
     is the intended cap, not a bug. Paging with the window buttons and `Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown`
     is as fast as before, and moving quickly between windows never leaves colours from the
     previous window behind.

3. **Shell app identity so toasts actually appear** — v0.3.5 showed no toast at all because an
   unpackaged exe has no AppUserModelID registered with the shell, and WinRT drops toasts from
   unregistered senders *silently*. The app now registers itself at start-up
   ([`app_identity.rs`](../apps/winmux/src-tauri/src/app_identity.rs) module doc carries the
   AUMID-match argument). These items are the field proof that could not be run on the Linux
   dev box.

   **Which exe to test with matters.** The plugin only puts our AUMID on the toast when the
   exe's folder does *not* end in `\target\debug` or `\target\release`, and this module mirrors
   that exception exactly. So an x64 `npm run tauri build -- --no-bundle` run **in place** from
   `target\release\` exercises neither path — it keeps the old PowerShell-sender fallback and
   proves nothing. Test with either of the two real field shapes: the exe **copied to a normal
   folder**, or the ARM64 cross-build artifact, whose folder is
   `target\aarch64-pc-windows-msvc\release\` and therefore does *not* match the exception even
   when run in place. That second shape is the one the original bug report came from. The
   start-up log tells you which branch you are on: a skipped dev build prints `start menu
   shortcut not needed (dev build — ...)`, never `up to date`.

   - **First run creates the Start-menu entry** — copy `winmux-app.exe` to a normal folder
     (e.g. `%LocalAppData%\winmux\winmux-app.exe`) and launch it once.
     `%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\winmux.lnk` must now exist, and typing
     `winmux` in the Start menu must find it. Right-click → Properties: **Target** is the exe
     you just launched.
   - **winmux appears in the notification list** — open Windows Settings › System ›
     Notifications: there must now be a **winmux** entry (this is the thing whose absence was
     the confirmed root cause). It may take a moment or a relaunch for the shell to index the
     new shortcut — see the last item.
   - **An unfocused needs-input toast really shows, from winmux** — start an agent turn that
     ends in a prompt, click away so the window is unfocused, and let it reach needs-input: a
     toast appears and the sender name on the card reads **winmux**, not Windows PowerShell.
     Then check Action Center — the toast is listed under winmux there too.
   - **Second launch is a no-op** — relaunch without moving anything. The console line reads
     `start menu shortcut up to date`, and the `.lnk` file's modified timestamp is
     **unchanged** (the shortcut must not be rewritten every boot).
   - **Moving the exe refreshes the target** — quit, move the exe to a different folder, launch
     it from there. The same `winmux.lnk` must now point at the **new** path (Properties →
     Target), not a second shortcut, and toasts must still show as winmux. This is the version
     swap case: the shortcut is refreshed, not created once and left stale.
   - **A failure is loud, not fatal** — no way to force this by hand, but if the registration
     ever fails the app must still boot normally and print a single
     `[winmux] app-identity: FAILED ...` line. Note that release builds are
     `windows_subsystem = "windows"` and have no console, so this line is only visible in a
     debug build or when the exe is started from a terminal that supplies one.
   - **Observation only — the first run may need a relaunch, and clicking does nothing.** Two
     accepted unknowns: (a) the shell may not index a brand-new shortcut before the first toast
     is raised, so if the very first toast is missing but the second launch works, that is the
     known indexing lag, not a regression — record which one it was; (b) clicking the toast has
     no activation handler wired, so nothing happening on click is acceptable for now. If it
     *does* focus the window, note that too.

### v0.3.7 — verification

The v0.3.7 batch. Items are independent — run them in any order on a build of this batch.
Every `settings.json` edit needs the app closed and relaunched (there is no settings UI).

1. **`settings.json` fonts reach the viewers, not just the terminal** — `fontFamily`/`fontSize`
   used to be consumed by xterm alone, so a user who picked a bigger font saw the terminal grow
   while the text viewer, the folder listing and markdown code stayed on their hard-coded
   `monospace` 12px (field report). The boot path now also plants the pair as `:root` custom
   properties those surfaces read; the scope argument and the deliberate exclusions live in the
   [`apps/winmux/src/viewer-font.ts`](../apps/winmux/src/viewer-font.ts) module doc.

   - **All three viewer surfaces follow the setting** — write
     `%AppData%\app.winmux.desktop\settings.json` as
     `{"fontFamily": "Cascadia Code, monospace", "fontSize": 20}` and relaunch. In one
     workspace open a folder tab (the listing), open a `.txt` or `.log` from it (the text
     viewer), and open a `.md` (the markdown viewer). The folder rows, the text viewer's lines
     and the markdown **code** spans and fenced blocks must all be Cascadia Code at 20px — the
     same face and size as the terminal in a neighbouring pane.
   - **The text viewer's row grid follows the size** — this is the item that can actually
     break, because the virtual scroller computes the grid in TypeScript while the glyphs are
     sized by CSS. In that 20px text viewer: lines must not be clipped or overlapping, each
     sitting in its own row with the same relative spacing as at the default size. Scroll into
     the middle of a long file and confirm the topmost visible line is a whole line, not one cut
     in half, and that `PageUp`/`PageDown` still stop on a line boundary. Close the tab and
     reopen the same file — it must come back at the same place. On a `.py` or `.rs` file the
     syntax colours must land on the same rows as the text (a grid mismatch shows up here first).
   - **Markdown prose is deliberately unchanged** *(partly superseded in v0.3.8: the prose now
     follows the **size** so that zoom moves the whole document — its face is still untouched.
     On a current build expect the body text to scale with `fontSize` and with zoom; run §10
     v0.3.8 item 1 instead.)* — in the markdown viewer the body text (paragraphs, headings,
     lists) keeps its previous look at any `fontSize`; only `code` takes the setting. The keys
     name the *code* font, not the document font.
   - **The chrome is not in scope** — the workspace sidebar, the pane tab bar, the tab/window
     buttons, the viewer banners and the top status line must look exactly as before at any
     `fontSize`. If the sidebar grew, the scope leaked.
   - **Unset must be indistinguishable from the old build** — quit, delete `settings.json` (or
     remove both font keys) and relaunch. The viewers must be back to the old rendering exactly:
     `monospace` at 12px, the folder size column one notch smaller than the name, and the text
     viewer on its original row grid. The CSS fallbacks exist for precisely this case, so a
     viewer that looks even slightly different from a pre-v0.3.7 build is a failure.
   - **Terminal zoom still does not touch the viewers** *(Historical — v0.3.8 extended zoom to
     the viewers on user request, so on any current build this item is expected to fail: the
     viewers move with the terminal. Zoom is still session-only. Run §10 v0.3.8 items 1-5
     instead.)* — with a size set (say 20) and a text viewer open beside a terminal, press
     `Ctrl+=`/`Ctrl+-` several times in the terminal, then `Ctrl+0`. The terminal font changes
     each time; the text viewer, the folder listing and markdown code must not move a pixel and
     their row grid must not shift. Zoom stays a terminal-only, session-only control (backlog
     2026-08-12) — the viewers are pinned to the file's value.
   - **The loud-fail rules are unchanged** — `{"fontSize": 200}` still reports the 6-72 range in
     the status line and boots with default fonts *everywhere*, viewers included; a blank
     `fontFamily` still reports itself. The viewers consume the same validated values the
     terminal does, so there is no second validation path to disagree.

2. **needs-input notification — toast only, and it now fires for workspaces you cannot see.**
   In v0.3.6 the chime rang but no toast ever appeared, and the two suspects could not be told
   apart from inside the app: WebView2's `document.hasFocus()` can stay `true` while the window
   is unfocused (so the front-end may have suppressed every toast), and
   `tauri-plugin-notification` throws the send into
   `tauri::async_runtime::spawn(async move { let _ = notification.show(); })` (2.3.3
   `desktop.rs:216`), swallowing any error. **Both layers are gone.** Focus is now decided by the
   OS window event the glue forwards (`main.rs` `window-focus` → `main.ts`), and the toast is
   raised directly through `tauri-winrt-notification` under the AUMID we register
   ([`app_identity.rs`](../apps/winmux/src-tauri/src/app_identity.rs)), with the result written to
   a log file. The chime was removed with it (user decision 2026-08-13) — the sound could never
   say *which* project was waiting, which is the whole content of the notification.

   Drive it with two workspaces open, side by side in the sidebar. In a terminal of the
   workspace you are *not* looking at, run

   ```bash
   sleep 5; ~/.winmux/bin/winmux-notify.sh winmux:needsInput "toast test"
   ```

   and use those five seconds to put the window into the state each case names. A real agent
   (Claude Code hitting a permission prompt) exercises the same path; the helper just makes the
   timing yours.

   - **Unfocused → toast** — click another window (an editor, Explorer) before the five seconds
     are up. A Windows toast appears bottom-right, titled `winmux — <workspace name>`, with the
     first line of the agent's last message as the body (`toast test` here); with no message
     recorded it reads `agent needs your input`. The workspace name is the point — it is how you
     know which project is waiting.
   - **Focused, but a workspace you are not viewing → toast** — this is the case v0.3.6 got
     wrong. Keep winmux focused (click into a terminal of the *other* workspace) and let the
     five seconds run out: **the toast still appears**, because that workspace is not on screen.
     Previously any focus at all suppressed it, so a second project going quiet was invisible.
   - **Focused, and it is the workspace on screen → nothing** — run the same command in the
     workspace you are actually looking at, with winmux focused. **No toast.** The sidebar card
     highlights and that is all — a toast on top of the window you are already reading is noise.
     Switching workspaces after the fact does not retro-fire it; only the rising transition
     notifies, so staying in `needs input` (later redraws, tab activity) produces nothing.
   - **No winmux chime, ever** — the app's own two-tone chime is gone, including in the focused
     case that used to be sound-only: if you hear it, this build is not the one you think it is.
     (The synthesiser is kept dormant in [`chime.ts`](../apps/winmux/src/chime.ts), unwired.)
     What you *may* still hear is **Windows' own notification sound** when a toast appears — we
     do not set an `<audio>` element, so the OS plays its default. That is Windows, not winmux,
     and it is silenced in Windows' notification settings, not here.
   - **The auto-reset case — a toast must still arrive after the webview reloads.** This is the
     one that unit tests cannot reach and the one v0.3.7's design turns on. Launch with
     `WINMUX_RESET_HIDDEN_SECS=20` (§9), leave the window unfocused (or minimized) for half a
     minute so the reset fires — the console prints `reset: reloading webview` — and then, still
     without touching winmux, trigger needs-input in the **active** workspace. The toast must
     appear. It relies on the front-end asking Windows for the current focus after each reload
     (`main.ts` `installWindowFocus`): the focus *event* only fires on a change, and that change
     happened long before the reload, so without the query the reloaded page would assume it is
     focused and swallow exactly the notification you are away from the machine to receive.
   - **When a toast does not show, read the log** — every attempt appends one line to
     `%AppData%\app.winmux.desktop\toast.log` (same folder as `settings.json`), local time first:

     ```text
     2026-08-13 21:04:11 ok title="winmux — winmux"
     2026-08-13 21:07:02 err title="winmux — winmux": cannot show the toast: <reason>
     ```

     That splits the failure three ways without a dev console: **no line** means the front-end
     never called (focus/onset judgment — check which case you were in), `ok` means Windows
     accepted it and the toast was suppressed downstream (notifications turned off for the app,
     Focus Assist, or the shell not having indexed the Start-menu shortcut yet), and `err` names
     the WinRT refusal. The message body is deliberately not logged. The file is capped at 64 KiB
     and starts over past that, so it cannot grow without bound.
   - **Failure still may not break anything else** — with notifications turned off for the app,
     the UI must keep working normally; the only traces are the `err`/`ok` line above and a
     `console.debug` (`needsInput toast failed`) in the dev console.
   - **Dev builds now register too** *(field note)* — the Start-menu shortcut used to be skipped
     when the exe sat in `target\debug`/`target\release`, because the plugin fell back to the
     PowerShell sender there. We always send under our own AUMID now, so that exception would
     silently kill dev-build toasts and was removed. Expect `npm run tauri dev` to create/refresh
     `winmux.lnk`, and expect alternating between a dev build and a release exe to rewrite its
     target each time (the log line `app-identity: ... shortcut updated` says so). The accepted
     cost: after a dev run, the Start-menu entry points at `target\debug\winmux-app.exe`, and
     wiping `target/` leaves it dangling until the next launch of whichever exe you keep. Deleting
     the shortcut by hand is safe — the next launch recreates it.

### v0.3.8 — verification

Zoom (`Ctrl+=` / `Ctrl+-` / `Ctrl+0`) now moves the **viewers** as well as the terminal, on one
key and one step. Until v0.3.7 it was terminal-only because re-sizing a live text viewer means
re-laying its row grid, not just its glyphs — so that grid is what most of this section is
about. Zoom stays session-only: nothing is written back to `settings.json`.

1. **All three viewer surfaces zoom** — open one workspace with a folder tab, a `.txt`/`.log`
   text viewer and a `.md` markdown viewer (split panes so you can see two at once, and keep a
   terminal visible in a third). Press `Ctrl+=` five times, then `Ctrl+-` five times. The folder
   rows, the text viewer's lines, the markdown body **and** its `code` spans must grow and shrink
   on every press. The markdown body must keep the document face — only its *size* follows zoom,
   never the code font.

2. **The text viewer keeps its place and its grid** — this is the item that can actually break.
   Open a file long enough to scroll (a few thousand lines), scroll to somewhere in the middle,
   and note the top visible line's text. Now zoom in three steps and out three steps.

   - The line that was at the top stays at the top at every step (not pixel-identical, but the
     *same line*, sitting flush against the top edge — never cut in half).
   - No line is clipped, overlapping or oddly spaced at any step: every glyph sits inside its own
     row exactly as at the default size.
   - The scrollbar thumb resizes as the content height changes; the view never jumps to the top
     or the bottom.
   - `PageUp`/`PageDown` still stop on a line boundary *after* zooming, and `Ctrl+PageUp`/
     `Ctrl+PageDown`/`Ctrl+Home`/`Ctrl+End` still move windows normally.
   - On a `.py` or `.rs` file the syntax colours stay on the same rows as the text at every zoom
     step (a grid mismatch shows up here first).
   - Switch to another tab and back, then close the tab and reopen the same file: it must come
     back at the same place *and* at the current zoom size, not the `settings.json` size.
   - **At the end of the file**, press `End` and then zoom *out* three steps: the view must stay
     pinned to the bottom. Here the top line is allowed to move (the document got shorter than
     the viewport could hold at that offset, so the browser clamps) and the topmost row may be
     cut — that is the one place the row grid does not hold, and it is accepted. Zooming back in
     will *not* return you to the line you started on; that is expected too.

   These two run in a real browser only: the unit tests cannot reach scroll clamping or the
   scroll events an assignment fires, so this item is the whole net for both.

3. **The markdown viewer keeps your place** — open a `.md` long enough to scroll (this repo's
   `WINDOWS-BUILD.md` will do), scroll to a paragraph in the middle and note it. Zoom in five
   steps, then out five steps. That paragraph must stay on screen at every step — the prose
   reflows, so it will drift by a line or two, but it must not scroll away. Then scroll to the
   very bottom and zoom out: the view stays at the bottom. Finally close the tab, reopen the
   file and press `Ctrl+0`: it must come back where you left it, at the `settings.json` size —
   zoom must not have written a zoomed position into the saved one.

4. **Zoom is responsive on a big file** — open the largest log you have (tens of MB is fine; the
   viewer only holds one 512 KiB window) and hold `Ctrl+=` down so the key repeats. The window
   must keep up without visible stalling or flicker and must not walk off its scroll position.
   Then hold `Ctrl+-` back down to the minimum. At the 6px floor and the 72px ceiling further
   presses must do *nothing* — no flicker, no scroll jump.

5. **Terminal and viewers move together** — with a terminal and a text viewer side by side, press
   `Ctrl+=` a few times: both grow on the same presses. They are not the same number (the terminal
   starts at 13px, the viewers at 12px when nothing is configured), so do not expect identical
   glyph sizes — expect them to move on every press. Each surface stops at its own 6/72 boundary,
   so at the extremes one can stop while the other still moves; that is expected. The terminal
   must reflow (its `cols`/`rows` change, and a running TUI redraws to the new size).

6. **`Ctrl+0` resets both to the file's values** — set
   `%AppData%\app.winmux.desktop\settings.json` to `{"fontFamily": "Cascadia Code, monospace",
   "fontSize": 20}` and relaunch. Zoom up and down a few steps in any pane, then press `Ctrl+0`:
   the terminal *and* all three viewer surfaces must land back on 20px Cascadia Code. Now delete
   the font keys (or the file), relaunch, zoom, and press `Ctrl+0` again: the viewers must return
   to exactly the pre-v0.3.7 look — `monospace` 12px, markdown body 13px, folder size column one
   notch smaller than the name.

7. **Relaunch discards zoom** — zoom several steps up, then close the app and relaunch. Every
   surface must come back at the `settings.json` size (or the defaults if unset). Nothing about
   the zoom may survive, and `settings.json` must be byte-identical to what you wrote — open it
   and confirm the app did not rewrite it.

8. **The chrome still does not scale** — at any zoom level the workspace sidebar, the pane tab
   bar, the tab/window buttons, the viewer banners, the text viewer's window-navigation bar and
   the top status line must look exactly as they did at the default. This is a content zoom, not
   a UI scale; if the sidebar grew, the scope leaked.

### v0.3.9 — verification

1. **Image paste reaches the agent** — `Ctrl+V` is no longer swallowed when the clipboard holds
   an image. The terminal never carries the image itself: the app inside it reads the OS
   clipboard on its own (Claude Code falls back xclip → wl-paste → `powershell.exe`'s
   `Clipboard::GetImage`, so it reaches the Windows clipboard from WSL), and all winmux has to
   do is let the keypress through.

   - Take a screenshot (`Win+Shift+S`), focus a Claude Code prompt in a winmux tab, press
     `Ctrl+V`: the image must attach (`[Image #1]` or that version's equivalent). Repeat with
     `Shift+Insert` — same path.
   - **Text paste is unchanged**: copy a line of text, press `Ctrl+V` at a plain shell prompt.
     The text arrives exactly once — twice would mean the native paste path fired as well — and
     a multi-line copy still arrives bracketed where the app supports it.
   - **An empty clipboard still does nothing**: with nothing copied, `Ctrl+V` at a bash prompt
     must leave the line untouched. If bash swallows your *next* keystroke instead, `\x16` leaked
     through as quoted-insert and the image check regressed.
   - With an image on the clipboard at a plain bash prompt that quoted-insert *is* what happens —
     bash has no use for the key. That is the accepted cost of forwarding it.

2. **A shell that never starts is called out, and is not killed** — the app now emits a
   startup marker (`OSC 777;winmux-started`) as the very first thing the WSL wrapper does, and
   flags the tab if no marker arrives within 20s. The session is left running, so a slow start
   costs a warning and nothing else.

   Both knobs are read once per process, so set them in the shell that launches the exe:

   ```powershell
   $env:WINMUX_STARTUP_DEADLINE_MS = "1000"; .\target\release\winmux-app.exe
   ```

   - **It fires on a genuinely slow start.** With the knob at `1000`, run `wsl --shutdown`,
     then open a new tab. The cold VM boot outlasts 1s, so the tab must show the `not started`
     badge and the pane banner naming WSL as the likely cause.
   - **It clears itself.** Keep watching that same tab: when the shell finally comes up the
     badge and banner must disappear on their own, and the prompt must work. This is the whole
     point of not killing the session — if the tab stays flagged after a working prompt
     appears, the recovery path regressed.
   - **No false positive at the default.** Unset the knob, `wsl --shutdown`, open a tab: the
     prompt must arrive with no badge at any point. Then restart the app with several running
     tabs *after* a `wsl --shutdown` — a cold VM plus N shells racing to initialise is the
     worst case for a false flag, and none may appear.
   - **Retry works and cleans up.** Force the flag again (knob at `1000`), press **Retry** in
     the banner: the same tab gets a working shell, and `↑` still recalls that tab's history
     (the tab id survived). Then check Task Manager and `ps` inside WSL — the session the tab
     had been holding must be gone. *If a `/init` relay with no children survives, note it: the
     field incident left two of those alive for hours, and whether killing `wsl.exe` reaches
     into WSL is exactly what this item measures.*

3. **A spawn cannot hold the whole app hostage** — spawning runs under the dispatcher lock, so
   it now carries a 5s deadline.

   ```powershell
   $env:WINMUX_SPAWN_DEADLINE_MS = "1"; .\target\release\winmux-app.exe
   ```

   - Opening a tab must fail visibly (a `SpawnFailed` error surface) rather than hang, and
     **the rest of the app must stay responsive** — switch workspaces, close a tab, type in
     another terminal while the failures repeat.
   - Repeat a handful of times, then check Task Manager: no `wsl.exe` may be left over. Late
     spawns are cleaned up by the worker thread, and this is the only place that path is
     exercised on real hardware.
   - Unset the knob and confirm tabs open normally again.

   A genuinely blocked `CreateProcess` cannot be produced on demand, so this item covers the
   error surface and the cleanup path only; the timeout mechanism itself is covered by the
   `deadline.rs` unit tests, including a 40-step sweep across the completion/deadline boundary
   that asserts the value is never lost.

4. **A dead terminal tab can be brought back** ([ADR-0010](adr/0010-restart-dead-terminal-tabs.md)) —
   a shell that dies while the app is running no longer leaves a permanently dead tab. A
   restart revives it automatically; within one run the pane banner's **Restart** does it on
   demand. Both keep the tab id, so the tab's shell history and its agent resume hint come back
   with it.

   - **Restart-revives (the field failure).** With a few tabs open — at least one running an
     agent that has finished a turn, so a resume hint exists — run `wsl --shutdown` from
     PowerShell. Every tab must go to the `exited` badge with the Restart banner. Now close
     winmux and reopen it: **every tab must come back with a live shell** in its own directory,
     no `exited` badge, and no `(terminal tab without pty session)` anywhere.
   - **The history and the resume hint survived.** In a revived agent tab, press `↑` once: the
     `claude --resume <id>` (or `codex resume <id>`) line must be there, and running it must
     reattach to that conversation. Press `↑` again for the tab's earlier commands.
   - **Restart without closing the app.** Type `exit` in a tab. The badge and banner appear
     with the last output still readable behind the banner; press **Restart**: the same tab
     gets a working shell, and `↑` still recalls that tab's history. Then confirm in Task
     Manager and `ps` inside WSL that the session the tab had been holding is gone.
   - **A running tab is never disturbed.** With one tab exited and others working, neither the
     restart nor a Restart press may touch the live tabs (no reset scrollback, no new prompt).
   - **A spawn failure is still recoverable.** With `$env:WINMUX_SPAWN_DEADLINE_MS = "1"`, open
     a tab and let it fail — it lands as `exited` with the Restart banner. Press **Restart**
     *in that same run*: it must fail again (the knob is still 1ms) and leave the badge and
     banner in place rather than a dead pane — i.e. the retry path stays available after a
     failed retry. Then quit, relaunch **without** the knob: the tab must come back with a
     live shell on its own. Before v0.3.9 that tab was dead for good on both counts.

### v0.3.10 — verification

1. **A revived spawn wave no longer outruns WSL** ([ADR-0010](adr/0010-restart-dead-terminal-tabs.md)
   amendment) — boot warms each distro once and paces the respawns, and a tab that still fails to
   start is retried automatically by the next restart rather than waiting for a click.

   ```powershell
   $env:WINMUX_RESPAWN_STAGGER_MS = "0"; .\target\release\winmux-app.exe   # reproduce
   ```

   `0` turns off **both** halves — the warm-up and the spacing — which is what makes it an
   actual reproduction rather than a burst against an already-warm VM.

   - **Reproduce first, on a cold VM.** With eight or more tabs open, `wsl --shutdown`, quit, then
     launch with the knob at `0`. Some tabs should land on the `not started` badge — that is the
     v0.3.9 failure. Note how many.
   - **Then the default.** `wsl --shutdown` again, quit, relaunch with the knob unset: the tabs
     must come up, and the window itself must appear immediately (the warm-up runs behind it, so a
     cold VM shows tabs filling in one by one rather than a frozen window).
   - **A failed tab heals on restart.** If any tab still lands on `not started`, quit and relaunch:
     it must be retried automatically with no click. Confirm with `ps -ef | grep 'bash -l'` inside
     WSL that the live shell count matches the tab count — the badge alone is not proof.
   - **No leftovers.** After the round, `Get-Process wsl` on Windows and `ps -ef | grep /init`
     inside WSL: each live tab should own one `SessionLeader → Relay → bash` triple, with no
     childless relays and no `wsl.exe` beyond the live tabs.

2. **A tab reopens where its shell was** ([ADR-0011](adr/0011-tab-cwd-tracking.md)) — the
   wrapper now emits `OSC 7` from `PROMPT_COMMAND`, so the tab's stored `cwd` follows the shell.

   - **The basic round trip.** In a tab, `cd` somewhere a few levels deep, quit the app, relaunch:
     that tab must come back in that directory, not the workspace root. Do it for two tabs in
     different directories in the same workspace — both must land correctly, which is what proves
     the value is per tab rather than per workspace.
   - **The prompt is the trigger, and that is fine.** `cd /tmp && sleep 30` then quit *during* the
     sleep: the tab comes back in `/tmp` (the prompt after the `cd` already reported it). A
     directory change made by a still-running program is not tracked — that is the documented
     limit, not a bug.
   - **Odd paths survive.** `mkdir -p "/tmp/wm test/100%dir" && cd "/tmp/wm test/100%dir"`, restart:
     the tab must reopen in exactly that directory, spaces, `%` and all.
   - **A deleted directory degrades loudly, not fatally.** `mkdir /tmp/gone && cd /tmp/gone`,
     quit, `rmdir /tmp/gone` from another tab, relaunch: the tab must come up **in `$HOME`** with
     one dim `[winmux] ... is gone` line — not a blank pane, not a `not started` badge.
   - **Titles are untouched.** With an agent running in a tab, `cd` around: the tab title must stay
     the agent's, never the directory name. If the title starts tracking directories, the OSC 0
     half of the snippet leaked in and the sidebar's purpose is gone.
   - **starship still owns the prompt.** The prompt must render exactly as before — same segments,
     same git status, and `$?`-dependent segments still correct after a failing command.

3. **Links reach the browser** ([ADR-0012](adr/0012-opening-links.md)) — clicking a URL in a tab
   opens it in the Windows default browser, and a program inside WSL that opens a browser itself
   (an OAuth login) now finds an opener.

   - **Click.** `echo https://example.com` in a tab, then click the URL (Ctrl is not required —
     xterm underlines it on hover). It must open in the **already-running** Chrome as a new tab,
     not a second browser instance. Repeat with a URL carrying query parameters
     (`https://example.com/?a=1&b=2`) and confirm the address bar shows both parameters — that is
     the case a command-line-based opener would mangle.
   - **Not inside a TUI.** Open an agent TUI (or `vim`) in a tab, put a URL on screen, click it:
     nothing must happen, and the click must reach the app as a click.
   - **Nothing but http(s).** `printf 'file:///etc/passwd\n'` and `printf 'ms-settings:privacy\n'`
     in a tab, then click: nothing may open. If Windows Settings appears, the scheme allowlist
     regressed.
   - **OAuth.** In a fresh tab run a login that opens a browser (`claude` logging in, or
     `gh auth login --web`). The browser must open on its own. If it prints "copy this URL
     manually", check `command -v xdg-open` inside that tab — it must resolve to
     `~/.winmux/bin/xdg-open`. (This needs provisioning v8, which runs once on first launch of
     this build; `~/.winmux/setup.log` records it.)
   - **The opener refuses what it should.** In a tab: `winmux-open ms-settings:privacy` must exit
     non-zero with a refusal, and `winmux-open ~/code` must open Explorer at that folder.

### v0.3.11 — verification

Both items need provisioning **v9**, which runs once on first launch of this build;
`~/.winmux/setup.log` records it. Check that first — neither item can pass without it.

1. **`winmux send` submits to an agent, not just a shell** — the CLI now ends the text with
   **CR** instead of LF, which is the byte a terminal sends for Enter.

   - **The case that was broken.** Open Codex (or Claude Code) in one tab and a shell in
     another. From the shell: `winmux send '#<agent tab id>' 'say hello'`. The agent must
     **start working**, not sit with the text in its prompt. This is the whole point of the
     change — before v0.3.11 the text arrived and nothing ran.
   - **The shell case did not regress.** `winmux send '#<shell tab id>' 'echo delivered'` must
     still run the line. A shell's `ICRNL` turns the CR back into a newline; if this one breaks,
     the terminal was opened in raw mode by something.
   - **`-l` still only pre-fills.** `winmux send -l '#<agent tab id>' 'say hello'` must leave the
     text in the prompt unsubmitted, in the agent and in a shell alike.

2. **A closed tab takes its shell-side files with it** — closing a tab (not a shell *exiting*)
   deletes that tab's `HISTFILE` and resume hint inside WSL.

   - **The delete.** In a tab, note its id (`winmux id`), run a command or two so its history
     file exists, and confirm from another tab:
     `ls ~/.winmux/history/tab-<id> ~/.winmux/resume/tab-<id>`. Close the tab, wait a second,
     and list again — both must be gone.
   - **One round trip, not N.** Open a workspace with several terminal tabs and close the whole
     **workspace**. All of their files must disappear, and `Get-Process wsl` during the close
     must not show a burst of `wsl.exe` processes — the cleanup is one call for all of them.
   - **An exited tab keeps its history.** In a tab, run a few commands, then type `exit`. The tab
     goes to the `exited` badge — its files must **still be there**, because Restart revives that
     tab under the same id and `↑` has to reach those commands. Restart it and confirm `↑` does.
   - **Quitting the app deletes nothing.** Close the app with tabs open, relaunch: every tab's
     history must survive, since quitting is not closing.

3. **Terminal panes have a visible scrollbar** — the app now draws its own instead of taking
   whatever WebView2's overlay mode gives it. Provisioning is irrelevant here; this one is pure
   front end.

   - **The bar is there before you touch it.** In a terminal tab, `seq 1 500`. A scrollbar must
     be visible on the right **without scrolling first**, its thumb sized to the scrollback, and
     dragging it must move the view.
   - **Confirm the cause while you are there.** Windows Settings › Accessibility › Visual
     effects › *Always show scrollbars*. Note whether it is on or off — the fix matters only
     when it is **off**, and knowing which state the field machine was in is what makes this
     result mean anything.
   - **It did not eat the terminal.** The bar takes ~10px, so `tput cols` should be one or two
     lower than before at the same window size, and no text may be clipped underneath it. Resize
     the window and confirm the terminal refits cleanly.
   - **Everything else that scrolls got one too.** Open a text viewer on a long file, a folder
     browser on a large directory, and a workspace list long enough to overflow the sidebar:
     each must show the same bar.
   - **An agent that scrolls itself is a different case.** With Claude Code running, check
     whether the pane shows a scrollbar. If it does not while a plain shell does, the agent is
     drawing on the alternate screen buffer, where there is no terminal scrollback to show — not
     a regression, and nothing app-side can change it.

### v0.3.12 — verification

The runtime log ([ADR-0014](adr/0014-opt-in-runtime-log.md)). Everything here is field-only: the
file is written by the Windows build, and the input events it exists to catch only happen in a
real WebView with a real IME.

1. **Off is genuinely off.** Launch with no `log` key in `settings.json` (or `"log": false`). No
   `winmux.log` may appear next to `state.json` — not an empty one either. Open tabs, split
   panes, type, switch workspaces, then look again: still nothing.

2. **On takes a restart, and says so in the file.** Add `"log": true`, and **without restarting**
   confirm no file appears. Restart: `winmux.log` must exist and its first line must be
   `log: enabled (v0.3.12)`. Wrong version there means the exe and the file are from different
   builds.

3. **The boot is in it.** After that restart the file must show the spawn lines for the restored
   tabs — `spawn: starting`, `spawn: session N up in <ms> ms` — with plausible durations. Compare
   the count against the tabs on screen; a tab with no spawn line is a finding.

4. **The IME case, which is why this exists.** With logging on, type Korean in a terminal tab.
   The file must show `ime: compositionstart`, `compositionupdate`, `compositionend` with
   `len=` counts — and **no Korean text anywhere in the file**. Grep it to be sure. Then, if the
   stuck-composition bug reproduces (previously typed syllable repeating, shortcuts dead): press
   Alt+Left a few times while stuck, click another pane to clear it, quit, and **keep the file** —
   it now carries the answer the code could not give. Look for whether a `compositionend` arrived
   before the `ime: shortcut dropped while composing` lines, and how long they continued.

5. **Terminal content never reaches it.** In a tab, `echo winmux-log-canary-12345`, and open a
   file in the text viewer. Neither the canary nor any file content may appear in `winmux.log`.

6. **It does not fill the disk or slow the terminal.** With logging on, `yes | head -c 20000000`
   in a tab (a heavy output burst): the terminal must stay responsive, and `winmux.log` must not
   grow with that output. Then check that rotation works at all — the file caps at 4 MiB and
   rolls into `winmux.log.1`.

7. **Turn it back off.** Set `"log": false`, restart, confirm nothing new is appended. The
   existing file stays — deleting the user's file is not ours to do.

## 11. ARM64 cross-build notes

The dev machine that produced this repo's crates is x86_64; the eventual target device policy
(터미널-계획-v2.md section 13) is ARM64. Cross-compiling *from* this x64 Windows machine *for*
ARM64 Windows:

1. Add the ARM64 MSVC build tools individually component in the Visual Studio Build Tools
   installer (see section 1 above) — the x64 build tools alone do not include the ARM64 linker.
2. Add the Rust target:

   ```powershell
   rustup target add aarch64-pc-windows-msvc
   ```

3. Build with `--target`:

   ```powershell
   cd apps\spike
   npm run tauri build -- --target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc --no-bundle
   ```

Cross-compiled ARM64 binaries can only be *built* here — running them and doing the actual
Spike verification (ConPTY OSC passthrough, IME, RAM) requires real ARM64 hardware (or an
ARM64 VM), since this machine cannot execute ARM64 Windows binaries. `crates/winmux-core` itself
has no target-specific code (it's checked against `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` in the WSL-side gate
per spike-plan.md section 5), so the ARM64-specific risk surface is `portable-pty`'s ConPTY
backend and Tauri/WebView2, not `winmux-core`.

### CI artifacts (stage 22) and device testing (stage 23)

Since stage 22, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the full gate set (including
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` — check-family
commands never link, so this needs no MSVC libraries and also runs on the Linux dev host)
on every push, and builds **release artifacts for both targets** on a manual
`workflow_dispatch` (GitHub → Actions → CI → Run workflow) or a `v*` tag: download
`winmux-aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` from the run's artifacts for the ARM64 device. A `v*` tag
additionally attaches `winmux-x64.exe` / `winmux-arm64.exe` to a GitHub Release — the
`workflow_dispatch` path stays workflow-artifacts-only.

Stage 23 (device verification) runs on the ARM64 machine, WSL2 + ARM64 Ubuntu installed:
1. The artifact runs natively (Task Manager shows no emulation; ARM64 process).
2. Spike-era regression spot: OSC routing (`osc-test.sh`), IME (한글), flood
   responsiveness, copy/paste — sections 5–6 spot checks.
3. Checkpoint-2 spot: one item each from the Stage 17/18/20/21 subsections of §10.
4. RAM: `scripts/win/measure.ps1 -ProcessName winmux-app` with the 4-pane + viewer
   composition from checkpoint 2 — same 100–150MB acceptance band.
5. Claude Code inside ARM64 WSL (and Codex CLI if its Linux ARM64 binary exists — 계획
   v2 section 13 precheck) with the hook contract wired.
