# ADR-0007: Stage 20 — the keyboard model and the canonical interception list

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-08-10 (stage landed 2026-08-09)

## Context

계획 v2 asks for two things in its keyboard chapters: one movement key per tier of the
three-tier structure (workspace / pane / tab), and an **explicit maintained list** of the
keys the app takes away from the terminal. Stage 20 delivered both
(`docs/plans/mvp-stage20-plan.md`, distilled here); the keyboard-first UX batch that
followed checkpoint 2 extended the same machinery with global shortcuts, and the
re-verification round on 2026-08-10 closed the two unverified preconditions.

Every key the app intercepts is a key the terminal loses, so each entry below is a
trade — that is why the list is a contract and not an implementation detail.

## Decisions

1. **One movement key per tier**: `Ctrl+1`…`Ctrl+9` (workspace by sidebar ordinal, 1-based),
   `Alt+arrows` (pane focus by on-screen geometry — nearest centre in the direction's
   half-plane), `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` (tab cycle inside the active pane, wrapping).
   The plan's alternative `Ctrl+↑↓` was rejected: TUI apps use `Ctrl+arrow`, and
   `Ctrl+1`–`9` already covers the tier.
2. **`keys.ts` is a pure decision module, and its module doc is the canonical interception
   list.** `keyAction` / `paneInDirection` / `workspaceAtOrdinal` / `nextTab` decide what a
   keydown *means* and what its target is; snapshot interpretation, dispatch and
   `preventDefault` stay in `main.ts`, and pane geometry is measured by `workspace-view`'s
   `paneRects()`. Keeping the table in the same file as the matcher is the whole point —
   the list and the code cannot drift apart. `shortcutLabel(id)` is the single source every
   tooltip reads, with a label→key round-trip test enforcing it.
3. **A matched combo is intercepted even when it resolves to a no-op** (ordinal past the
   last workspace, no pane in that direction, 0–1 tabs). A key that leaks into the shell
   only *sometimes* is worse than a key that is consistently dead: `Ctrl+9` must never type
   a `9` into a command line just because there are three workspaces.
4. **Global shortcuts are `Ctrl+Shift` only.** Plain `Ctrl` combos stay shell-owned —
   `Ctrl+W` is bash's word erase, `Ctrl+D` is EOF, `Ctrl+E` is end-of-line, and taking any
   of them breaks the terminal. `Ctrl+Shift+C`/`V` are copy/paste convention and are never
   assigned to anything else. The set: `W` close active tab, `T` new terminal tab, `B`
   folder browser tab, `D`/`E` splits, `N` new workspace, `[`/`]` workspace cycle.
5. **`F2` renames the active workspace — a knowingly-paid cost.** Bare `F2` is a key TUI
   apps actually use (`mc`'s Rename), and intercepting it means those apps never see it.
   Accepted because "rename is F2" is a desktop-wide convention with no equally
   discoverable substitute. This is the opposite conclusion from ADR-0003 decision 8, where
   F5 was left to the terminal precisely because `Ctrl+Shift+R` was an equally good reload
   key. Both live in the same table so the asymmetry is visible rather than accidental.
6. **IME composition passes through untouched** — a keydown while `isComposing` belongs to
   the composer, never to the app.
7. **Matching is `ev.key`-based and therefore layout-sensitive; the conservative rule is to
   match only what is listed.** Shift variants of other combos (`Ctrl+Shift+1`,
   `Alt+Shift+←`) are deliberately unmatched, because shift produces different characters on
   different layouts. `Ctrl+Shift+[` / `]` meet that problem head-on and so match **both**
   the printed characters and their shifted forms (`{` / `}`).
8. **Recorded shadowing**: `Ctrl+1`–`9` covers the xterm control characters `Ctrl+2`…`Ctrl+8`
   (notably `Ctrl+3` as an Escape substitute). That is the price of the tier key the plan
   assigns, and it is in the table rather than in someone's memory.

## Verification

Checkpoint 2 (`docs/WINDOWS-BUILD.md` §10, stage-20 items 1–5) passed on Windows
2026-08-09: all three tiers including their no-op boundaries, and the two-sided check that
intercepted keys leave nothing in the shell **while** un-intercepted ones still reach it
(bare `Tab` completes, bare arrows walk history, `Ctrl+C` still interrupts). The conditional
item held — **WebView2 does deliver `Ctrl+Tab` to the page**, so no replacement binding was
needed.

The re-verification round on 2026-08-10 closed the second precondition: the six
`Ctrl+Shift` globals are Chromium accelerator combos (incognito, reopen tab, bookmarks) and
**WebView2 does not consume them**, so `AreBrowserAcceleratorKeysEnabled(false)` was not
needed either. Automated: the `keys.ts` suite covers the full mapping, the IME guard, the
boundaries and the label round-trip.

## Follow-up landed after re-verification: `Shift+Enter`

A terminal cannot distinguish `Enter` from `Shift+Enter` — both are CR — so agents that
want "newline without submitting" agree on an out-of-band sequence. Claude Code's is
`ESC CR`, which its `/terminal-setup` installs into VS Code and iTerm2 keymaps. The
terminal view now emits `\x1b\r` for the combo itself (preventDefault plus blocking xterm's
default CR), so the flow works in winmux **without** running `/terminal-setup`. Plain
`Enter` is untouched, so shells and `vim` behave exactly as before, and effectively no
terminal program assigns `Shift+Enter` its own meaning. The interception happens in
`terminal-view`'s `customKeyEventHandler` (next to copy/paste, which is where xterm-level
rewrites belong) but is listed in the `keys.ts` table like everything else — the table is
canonical regardless of which module enforces a row. Verification is item 1 of §10's
post-re-verification subsection.

## Follow-ups

- Splitter resize is mouse-drag only; there is no keyboard equivalent for the drag handle.
- The `ev.key` layout assumption (decision 7) is checked only on the layouts this developer
  runs; revisit if a non-US layout ever becomes a supported target.
